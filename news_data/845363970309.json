When I exit he editor after an editing session, I save the changes before I close the editor.  If I forget to save, I get a reminder from the editor. So far so good.    My problem is that Calibre doesn't seem to update the file after an editing session.  If I open the editor again, all those changes are gone, and the file starts as if I never edited anything.    To avoid that, I have to remove the edited file from the calibre folder, delete the book in Calibre and then load it in Calibre again for it to recognize the changes. I do sometimes forget to do that and have lost many hours of work that way.    It doesn't matter if Calibre overwrites the file in the Calibre folder, because that is only a copy of the file that you imported. That unedited file remains in its original location on the computer.    Is it possible to make the editor give Calibre a signal that would force Calibre to update its file and folder to the edited file whenever the editor is exited?    TIA","contentWithMarkup":"Calibre 3.25 on Win10 PC.    When I exit he editor after an editing session, I save the changes before I close the editor.
