Tonight there will be no falling stars (we hope) and plenty of ascending stars as the Summer Lyric Theatre at Tulane University celebrates the music and theater of Leonard Bernstein.    With a special Lagniappe concert preceding its regular summer season of musicals, Summer Lyric commemorates the centennial of the birth of the 20th century's most important musician, composer and conductor. His influence would touch virtually all forms of American music, from classical and opera to musical theater, jazz and popular song.    BERNSTEIN AT 100!  What: The Summer Lyric Theatre at Tulane University opens its season with a special concert honoring one of America's most influential artists, Leonard Berstein, in his centennial year. Michael McKelvey directs; Jaune Buisson choreographs; C. Leonard Raybon conducts the orchestra.  Where: Dixon Hall, Tulane University, 6823 St. Charles Ave.  When: Performances at 8 Saturday, June 2 and at 3 on Sunday, June 3.  Admission: $20-$40. For information, call (504) 865.5269 or visit the company's website . Information on subscriptions to the summer season lineup of \"My Fair Lady,\" \"Ragtime\" and \"Newsies\" also is available on the website.    This weekend's concert (June 2-3) will feature performances from his most important stage works, including perennial hits such as \"West Side Story,\" \"On the Town\" and \"Wonderful Town,\" as well as gems from lesser performed works such as \"Candide\" \"Mass,\" \"Peter Pan\" (his 1950 version) and \"1600 Pennsylvania Ave.\"   The concert will feature some of the city's brightest stars. In addition, an assortment of up-and-coming young performers, several of whom have virtually grown up on the Summer Lyric stage, will be featured, bringing a total of 60 singers and dancers to the stage at Dixon Hall.    Highlights to watch for include opera star Melissa Marshall's virtuoso rendition of the diva's delight, \"Glitter and Be Gay\" from \"Candide.\"   Leslie Castay tackles the frantic \"What a Movie!\" from Bernstein's rarely staged opera, \"Trouble in Tahiti.\" Amy Alvarez offers a smooth jazz take on \"A Little Bit in Love\" from \"Wonderful Town.\"    John Michael Haas has taken full local ownership of the role of Tony from \"West Side Story.\" On the Dixon Hall stage, he joins his rich tenor with the warm soprano of Rachel Looney's Maria for \"Tonight\" from the legendary show. A full segment from \"West Side Story\" opens the second act, with the ensemble delivering a sizzling \"Cool,\" led by Polanco Jones. And the \"Mambo\" showcases some of Bernstein's finest orchestral work for theater.    It is fitting that many of the younger members of the ensemble are front and center for numbers from \"On the Town,\" capturing the vibrant youth that bursts from his first Broadway show.    And any Summer Lyric show without Elizabeth Argus is unimaginable. Watch for the company's favorite leading lady in a rollicking rendition of \"I Am Easily Assimilated\" from \"Candide.\"    \"Candide\" also provides the grandly moving finale to the concert with Marshall and Haas leading the entire ensemble in a ringing performance of \"Make Our Garden Grow.\" (Wouldn't it be lovely to see a full staging of \"Candide\" on some upcoming season?)    Summer Lyric's Artistic Director Michael McKelvey directs the program, with C. Leonard Raybon conducting the orchestra. Jaune Buisson choreographs the show. Audiences also will hear from Bernstein himself, through a series of video clips designed by Mason Wood.    Audiences also can see many of these performers in Summer Lyric's slate of shows beginning later this month. The regular season opens with Lerner and Loewe's classic \"My Fair Lady\" (June 21-24), followed by \"Ragtime\" (July 12-15). The season wraps up with a newer show for the company, \"Newsies\" (Aug. 2-5), the hit adaptation of the Disney film.","contentWithMarkup":"Tonight, tonight, won't be just any night, indeed!
