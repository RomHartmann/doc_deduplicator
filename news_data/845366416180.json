The media failed to give him the press coverage they would have given anyone else making this much news.  3. And the unquestioned lies the media let become the history of the campaign though there was no basis for the lies.   4. If you look at polling at press coverage here was a candidate polling better in matchups with the GOP than Hillary yet the press would repeat her claim seemingly daily to being the only electable Democrat.  (Even after Nevada more Democrats have voted for Bernie than for Hillary.)  The ‘only’ electable Democrat won one Primary by a few coin flips and a handful of votes, then got walloped and then had uncle Harry* quasi-legally and not at all ethically get out of the vote for her in Nevada while he declared he was neutral.  5. Then there’s the dereliction of its duty to report the news.  The press covered Hillary’s speeches and activities at least 10 times more than Bernie.  6. And the press didn’t cover her nonsense, like she was a progressive who got things done.  This is in the face that progressives and up to this year Hillary Clinton herself would not consider her a progressive.  And for getting things done – I have not heard any major media outlet ask her what it is she has accomplished.  What has she gotten done?  How many of those things she got done were progressive?  And how many anti-progressive programs has she supported?    What are labels anyway?  A neo-liberal can call herself a progressive, those that she helped oppress support her, she can claim that her opponent knows nothing of foreign policy though she is the one who has made several major foreign policy blunders during her career, can claim she will reign in Wall Street when being gifted inordinately large sums by Wall Street.  The Game is Rigged.    With the blackout from the press Bernie not only had to campaign but introduce himself to the American populace.  Not enough time.  Not enough Bernie (or anyone else for that matter) for the task.  Even Elizabeth Warren, the goddess of progressivism, is not giving a hand.  The Game is Rigged.    He stood without much help from big power – it’s true there’s Rep. Ellison and legions of millennials and Mr. Jealous and some black intellectuals and Robert Reich and Thomas Piketty, but she’s got the juggernaut.  And our little contributions cannot go on forever.    The Game is Rigged.  The media is in cahoots, and elected politicians, and union leaders** and of course almost all of big money.  Hillary Clinton is one of them, there’s nothing pure or ethically good it’s just power, a whole bunch of power protecting itself, and power trumps (hah!) what is right.  What is fair.    “But many union members, both Democrats and many independents, believe in the policies and the overall vision of an expanded New Deal that both the labor movement and Sanders have long promoted. Yet Sanders appears to have more confidence that the broad American public will back those ideas and reject likely Republican and media attacks on his proposals, or on his self-described “democratic socialism,” than do many top union officials who often complain about Democrats who will not support labor and its agenda.” http://inthesetimes.com/working/entry/18786/unions-bernie-sanders-hillary-clinton-labor    The Game is Rigged         The post The Game is Rigged appeared first on Pulpdiddy's Place .","contentWithMarkup":"<p>Bernie is right – the game is rigged.  And when you tell the establishment it doesn’t care about people then it shows that it does care – about protecting itself.  I thought I was seeing the impossible.  But then I got slapped by the tsunami of self interest that exists in American politics.</p>\n<p>1.Bernie was getting the cold shoulder from all the politicians he worked with these last 20+ years in Congress.  2.
