I guess it keeps my mind busy and wondering different things.   Well not lay in the floor laughing funny but still funny. When I look at ordinary objects besides cloud formations that we all look at and find objects, I sometimes see shapes of people or just things. Take this piece of Ginger that I purchased at the grocery store the other day, I say other day, it may have been several months ago.   I thought what an unusual shape and then I got to looking at it and saw a mermaid with her baby and then an angel with at baby . I then looked close and could see a nose and eyes of the lady holding clutching a baby in her arms.   I never did cut it up wanting to keep the wonderful shape until it dried up and got really really ugly.  Ginger seems to do that when it has dried up. There is, outside of course, a light pole thing with transformers and such on it.    I see this every day and to me it looks like a ski person with it's poles and legs bent really working at getting down the hill of snow.   It even survived the hurricane and just waiting for us when we got home.  I am very curious about shapes and what they form I guess.     Here is a sketch I have done a painting of and parts of it I didn't know what it was so I just painted the shape and that is all.  In the finished painted you can't tell what I shaped.  lol  Just a fancy way of saying I guessed and painted. I have this plain Jane wall in this house and just put some of my like paintings on it, lots of shapes in painting these for sure and a tad of color.  Not the most exciting way to hang the paintings until we find the right place to spend our next many years this works for me and they don't have to live in a box waiting patiently for their forever home.  Only \"Wind Dancer\", the horse is full size the other two animals are prints of original art work I have done    \"Tatonka\", the buffalo and \"The Sentinel\", the deer.    Here is the original of \"Tatonka\" he is also a 30 inch by 40 inch painting.    I have finished another painting that size but will share him next time.  The young lady that owns this \"Tatonka\" has displayed him wonderfully and has such a decorating touch.  I told her decorating is certainly her calling.  I just had to share this photo of some of her handy work.   I thought was brilliant to put him on this screen and it really makes him pop.     I don't have any CQ work to share today but for the next time.   I think the Kite and Sand Fest might have worn out your eyes.                          Thank you for stopping by and seeing what is going on in my world.  xooxxo Annette","contentWithMarkup":"<div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\"></div> Hello and Happy June,  I know late Spring has hit us all right now being toasty warm or just plain HOT , well except my friends in Australia and it is Fall and I suspect toasty hot also.   Sometimes it is hard to wrap my mind around that.same planet and different season zones.We do have different time zones and hate, yes a strong word but hate daylight savings time.      It is funny to see and think about different subjects like that.
