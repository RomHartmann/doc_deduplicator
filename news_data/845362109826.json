After a while, the editor slows down because there are so many pages open.  To resolve that, I have to close the editor, remove the epub file from Calibre and then load it again.    Would it be possible to add a button that closes all open pages, so I won't have to exit?  If it already exists, where do I find it to add it to the toolbar?  TIA.","contentWithMarkup":"I often work with very large epub files with hundreds of pages.  After a while, the editor slows down because there are so many pages open.
