While the ultimate goal appears to be glasses-free 3D, this advancement will, at least, allow 3D films to look their best. The director also called Hollywood out for relying on post-conversion rather than shooting natively. \"They will be, to the best of my ability, the best 3D that’s possible to make. That includes collaborating with the people at Dolby Cinema, who have developed high dynamic range projection that could put 16 foot-lamberts of light on a 3D screen through the glasses, which is revolutionary. Normally, you’re looking at about three foot-lamberts. Sixteen is what you should be seeing. That’s what movies should look like.\" Discussion Posted by Megalith 4:00 PM (CDT)  ","contentWithMarkup":"James Cameron revolutionized visual effects and 3D cinema with 2009's Avatar, and he plans to do it again when the sequel debuts in December 2020 with a new projection system that will solve the problem of 3D movies looking too dark.
