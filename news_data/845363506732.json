An empty church on East Sixth Street owned by the Russian Orthodox Church in America caught on fire early Saturday afternoon, a little less than a year after a previous fire.     No injuries were thought to have resulted from the fire, which was called into emergency crews at about 12:28 p.m.    Seven Roswell Fire Department fire trucks responded to 337 E. Sixth St. to find the building “fully involved” in flames, according to Fire Marshal Matt Miller. By 2:18 p.m., the fire was thought to be under control, as some crews began to leave the scene.    Miller said the cause of this fire is unknown. An investigation of the previous incident in July 2017, when the building was being used as a church and a living quarters for a few people, concluded that an overloaded electrical breaker in one of the living areas was the likely cause of that fire, he said.    Stephen Lee, chairman of the board of governors for the church, which had been operating under the name of Holy Protection of the Mother of God Orthodox Church, said the building was vacated after the first fire. He said it needed about $300,000 in repairs.    “I have no idea what the motive would be,” he said about the Saturday incident. “There is nothing of value in the building.”    According to neighbors at the scene, people were sometimes thought to have stayed in or used the empty building at times. Miller said he had heard reports of that but could not provide definitive confirmation at this time.","contentWithMarkup":"Fire crews spray a church in the 300 block of East Sixth Street near North Garden Avenue that caught on fire the afternoon of June 2.
