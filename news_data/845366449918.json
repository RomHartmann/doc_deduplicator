The access for Pruitt, the administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency, also included watching from the players' entrance as the team streamed onto the court, and posing for a photo with a star player in the locker room area.  But there was more to the game in December than a superfan experience for Pruitt and his son, who joined him. They sat in seats belonging to Joseph W. Craft III, a billionaire coal executive who has aggressively campaigned to reverse the Obama administration's environmental crackdown on the coal industry. Craft and his wife donated more than $2 million to support President Donald Trump's candidacy and inauguration.  Pruitt's attendance at the game followed a year of regulatory victories for Craft, who maintains close ties to Pruitt even as he has lobbied the EPA on issues important to his company, Alliance Resource Partners. And unlike other executives with whom Pruitt is known to have close ties, Craft has stayed relatively under the radar.  A major contributor to Pruitt's campaigns in Oklahoma when Pruitt served in state government, Craft saw Pruitt at least seven times during his first 14 months at the EPA, agency records and e-mails show, and they were scheduled to appear together on at least two other occasions. That is more than Pruitt has met with representatives of any environmental group.  The relationship is so close that the two men trade text messages, with Craft proposing in one July 2017 exchange a possible \"long-awaited\" dinner and another visit with his company's executives.  It has been an auspicious turnaround for Alliance and for Craft, who in nearly 40 years in the coal industry had felt unwelcome at the EPA, apparently never even setting foot in the agency's headquarters, one executive told an energy conference last fall.  Pruitt's mostly behind-the-scenes relationship with Craft is emblematic of his unorthodox approach to leading the EPA, where, as administrator, he has become the subject of a dozen ethical and other investigations.  In October, Pruitt traveled to Craft's childhood hometown, Hazard, Ky., where, with Craft in the audience, he announced the repeal of the Clean Power Plan, an Obama-era policy to curb greenhouse gas emissions from power plants. A month earlier, Pruitt postponed enforcement of a rule forbidding coal-powered plants from dumping toxic metals into rivers, a move requested by a coal industry group with Craft on its board.  E-mails and schedules show that Craft and Pruitt planned to meet in Naples, Fla., for a gathering of the National Mining Association's board of directors. Pruitt also met with the board of Craft's company in a private dining room at the Trump International Hotel near the White House, according to schedules and e-mails made public by the EPA in response to records requests.  There was no mention on Pruitt's calendar of the Kentucky basketball game outing. Pruitt was accompanied not only by his security detail on the trip, but also by Kentucky state police, according to an e-mail exchange between university police officers.  Heath Lovell, vice president for public affairs at Alliance, said that Pruitt had wanted to take his son to the game while visiting Lexington, and had reached out to Craft, who sold him the tickets at \"market value.\"  EPA spokesman Jahan Wilcox said that Pruitt paid $130 in cash for each ticket. An e-mail from the EPA ethics office approving the purchase of the tickets said that payment would be made by check, but since it was a cash transaction, there is no receipt.  Craft gained access to the tickets as a major financial backer of the university, having donated more than $10 million to the school to help build basketball and football training facilities, both of which bear his name. His wife, Kelly Knight Craft, was previously a university trustee and was a prolific Republican fundraiser until she was appointed by Trump last year as U.S. ambassador to Canada.  Craft, 67, and Pruitt, 50, have deep ties to Kentucky. Pruitt, who was born and raised in the state, briefly played baseball at the University of Kentucky on a scholarship; Craft, also a Kentucky native, earned both his undergraduate and law degrees from the university.  Both men later advanced their professional lives in Oklahoma, where Alliance has its corporate headquarters and where Pruitt served as a Republican state lawmaker and attorney general before joining the Trump administration. The two met in Oklahoma in the mid-2000s, Lovell said, when Pruitt sought out the coal executive after his hearing about his connection to Kentucky sports. Craft owns a mansion in Tulsa about a mile from Pruitt's home.","contentWithMarkup":"LEXINGTON, Ky.
