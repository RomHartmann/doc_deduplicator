{"sequenceId":"845362309253","id":"34207114595","language":"English","title":"Subsea Pressure Intensifier","content":"Cameron, a Schlumberger company, offers blowout-preventer (BOP) -control point-of-distribution functionality and pressure differential in a subsea pressure intensifier (SPI). The amount of control fluid stored in subsea mounted accumulators can be increased by boosting the working pressure from a conventional 5,000 psi (34.5 MPa) up to the full rated pressure of 7,500 psi 951.7 MPa0. Using technology similar to that of a BOP bonnet piston, the intensifier unit strokes lower pressure fluid through a large-diameter chamber into a small-diameter chamber to output a higher-pressure fluid. Available for newbuild rigs or as a retrofittable option, the SPI is a space-saving, economical solution that enables improved shearing capability, extended operating work area into greater water depths, minimized weight increase on existing BOP stacks, and compliance of rig capacity with Bureau of Safety and Environmental Enforcement Well Control Rule and American Petroleum Institute Specification 16D. The SPI system is a simple and more-cost-effective solution for increasing usable volume when compared with traditional hotline reel systems.
