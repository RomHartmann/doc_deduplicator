Photo by Chris Stone  High temperatures were starting to take hold in the San Diego County desert Saturday, ahead of an excessive heat warning issued by the National Weather Service for Sunday and Monday.    Borrego Springs was facing a high of 103 degrees Saturday afternoon. Temperatures in the region were expected to be even higher on Sunday and Monday, with afternoon highs expected to reach 109 to 112 degrees.    Such searing conditions “greatly increase the chance of heat illnesses, especially for those who are not acclimated,” the federal agency cautioned.    People in the affected areas are advised to fortify themselves by drinking plenty of fluids, stay out of the midday sun and seek air-conditioned buildings.    On the plus side, evening lows were predicted to be in the 70s.    Other communities in the region covered by the heat warning include Banning, Cathedral City, Coachella, Desert Hot Springs, Indio, La Quinta, Palm Desert and Palm Springs.    –City News Service was last modified: June 2nd, 2018 by Debbie L.
