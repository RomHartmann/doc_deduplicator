Three men were in the boat around 10 a.m. Saturday when it was pulled into water being discharged from Fort Loudoun Dam, according to a Tennessee Wildlife Resources Agency press release.    The Knoxville News Sentinel reports all the men went overboard as the boat got too close to the dam, capsized and was forced under by the falling water. The release says the men were believed to be wearing life jackets, but the force of the water caused some to be torn off.    Two of the men were taken to the hospital, and one has been confirmed dead, the release said.
