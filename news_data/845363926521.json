{"sequenceId":"845363926521","id":"34207168753","language":"English","title":"100, 75, 50 and 25 years ago for week of June 3-9","content":"– A patriotic tea commemorating Jefferson Davis’ birthday was given Thursday by the United Daughters of the Confederacy at the home of Mrs. J.E. Ryan. The home was beautifully decorated in the theme of the “Old South” with profusions of magnolia blossoms throughout the living room. Mrs. J.P. Pool introduced her granddaughter, Miss Peggy Hooper, who represented in her costume Winnie Davis, the first daughter of the Confederacy.   1943   JUNE 3 – County Farm Agent John Saunders explained to members of the Victoria County Agricultural Council details of a new plan for providing Texas farmers with minimum labor needed to harvest their crops during the next six months. The recently passed Labor Placement and Recruitment Bill made available the sum of $26,100,000 in federal money for use in getting crops harvested.    JUNE 4 – Members of the Lions Club were entertained with music by four instrumentalists of Foster Field and tap dancing numbers by two pupils of the Lillian Cain School of Dancing at Thursday’s luncheon at the Manhattan. B.E. Leissner and W.R. McCright arranged the program. The dancers were Renette Hyak, little daughter of Mr. and Mrs. M. Hyak, and Donnie Leissner, son of Mr. and Mrs. B.E. Leissner.    JUNE 5 – The commanding officer of Aloe Field had received authority to sell the remaining lumber in the Aloe Field scrap pile for one dollar per truck load. The lumber consists mainly of firewood, kindling and very small patchwork material. The scrap pile is the result of lumber left over from the construction of the field. Before it was scrapped, however, the lumber was put to every possible use. All pieces over four feet in length were used in making board walks to run between buildings and areas, which resulted in a saving of $16,000 over the cost of cement walks.   1968   JUNE 7 – A baton twirling class of boys and girls eight years and up will begin at the YMCA June 18. The class will be taught by Mary Beth Pogue, who is a former national champion twirler. Since college, she has taught in Victoria, serving as sponsor and choreographer of the Victoriadores.    JUNE 8 – Wallace Gill, executive director of the Victoria YMCA, announced Friday that the “Y” will close Sunday in observance of the National Day of Mourning for the late Senator Robert Kennedy.   1993   JUNE 9 – Margery Engle Loeb of Victoria has been elected to a second consecutive term as chair of the Social Work Foundation Advisory Council for the School of Social Work at the University of Texas at Austin for 1993-94. Loeb originally led the group in 1992-93. She has been a member of the advisory council since 1990, when she was appointed to a three-year term by UT president William H. Cunningham. She received a master of science degree in social work from UT and maintains a private practice in Victoria.","contentWithMarkup":"– A patriotic tea commemorating Jefferson Davis’ birthday was given Thursday by the United Daughters of the Confederacy at the home of Mrs. J.E.
