(Courtesy: Jabari Giles)    OKLAHOMA CITY (KOKH) —    For the first time since the shooting, Jabari Giles went back to Louie's Lakeside.    A man opened fire on people visiting the restaurant on Lake Hefner on May 24, injuring Giles' daughter, before civilians shot the suspect down.    Giles says it was hard to make that first trip back, but he wanted to do it.    \"We came out here today because we heard Louie's was doing a fundraiser type thing for Syniah and Alex and we just wanted to come and thank them for doing it. The outpouring of love and support from all of Oklahoma City, actually across the country, has been amazing,\" he said.    His daughter Syniah Giles, 12, and her friend Alex Speegle, 15 were both hospitalized with gunshot wounds. Syniah was released from the hospital Tuesday evening.     \"It's been a really rough week. Really just focusing on Syniah getting better, getting out of the hospital,\" Jabari said. \"We finally got her home and she's resting and recovering ever since.\"    Louie's is collecting money at the Lake Hefner donation. Donations will be doubled by the restaurant.    GoFundMe pages were also set up for the Giles family and for Speegle to help with medical costs.","contentWithMarkup":"Jabari Giles poses with his daughter at home after she was released from the hospital.
