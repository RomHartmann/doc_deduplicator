It maintains high-level firepower and maneuverability, but now offers additional protection, especially in the front.   Entering service with the German Bundeswehr in the mid ‘80s, the Leopard 2A4 was the final modification of the early serial production Leopard 2. War Thunder tankers and fans of German ground vehicles can look forward to the addition of one of the most iconic German steel beasts of all time, coming to the game with update 1.79!  Based on the testing results gathered from the various different Leopard 2K prototypes, a new Leopard 2 prototype was constructed that would be more representative of the final version of the vehicle. Designated as Leopard 2AV, the new prototype featured a redesigned hull and turret over the Leopard 2K. Furthermore, the prototype was tested with two different cannons; the British L7 105mm rifled and the German Rheinmetall 120mm smoothbore cannon.","contentWithMarkup":"<div class=\"e-accentBlock\">\n\n<span class=\"t-highlighted-text\">In short: the most up to date \"Leopard\" in-game, a new top-tiered vehicle in the German line-up.
