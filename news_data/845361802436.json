But in a new message he says he's not asking them to pay for it, only \"to believe with me.\" \"I've never raised money for the plane,\" Duplantis says. \"I put it in our magazine and said, 'Believe God with me.' There's a vast difference between 'believe in God' and asking for money. \"Now it takes money to run anything; that's common sense. But the Lord told me many years ago ... 'You don't need to raise money for this. This will just come.'\" Duplantis says his 40-year-old ministry has reached 106 million U.S. households and 2.9 billion people worldwide. Among the Jesse Duplantis Ministries' holdings in Destrehan are Covenant Church and what the St. Charles Herald-Guide has described as a 34,986-square foot house with 25 rooms and two double-car garages. In his \"This Week With Jesse\" video posted May 21, Duplantis said he is eyeing a Dassault Falcon 7X, a three-engine jet with a range of 5,950 nautical miles. The list price for a new one is $54 million. After Christian Post published a story about the solicitation, NOLA.com | The Times-Picayune and national news outlets followed up with their own. That generated what Duplantis says was a big response, some of it negative. \"I'm not depressed. I'm not discouraged,\" he says in a new video, titled, \"Special Message From Jesse.\" \"In fact, I am excited. I have never had this much press in my life.\" The Beauty of the 7X Is More Than Skin Deep Others have been supportive, he said: \"I have to say that there's a lot of people have called me and said, 'I want to get involved in that new plane you're believing for. I say, 'Well, that's up to you, but I never asked you for it. \"'And there's nothing wrong with asking you for it. That's not the issue. But I didn't because I'm following the direction that the Lord told me.' \"I've raised money for a lot of things, and there's nothing wrong with that because religious organizations do that. I'm not asking you to pay for my plane. ... I'm believing, and I want you to believe with me.\" . . . . . . .
