We actually got seats on the front row to watch him.  My friend Janice sent me a text teasing me about being, \"a front row joe\"!  I was grateful to have no one in front of me while I recorded Parker playing. Parker is in Concert Band now.  He played three songs that night.  My favorite was Incantation and Ritual by Brian Balmages.  The kids really had improved a lot since their last concert.  Parker really enjoys having Mr. Leman as his band teacher.  They recently participated in a local band festival too. I gave Parker some milk and cookies when we got home.  I am glad that he loves playing the clarinet and is developing his talent.  We love our teenager!","contentWithMarkup":"<div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-Ch7IAaI0oHw/WtTYSqlEzsI/AAAAAAAAXeY/4hgRvblarH4m1O13bh8vHAoV7FJZMqlmwCLcBGAs/s1600/20180321_203030.jpg\" imageanchor=\"1\" style=\"margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;\"><img border=\"0\" data-original-height=\"900\" data-original-width=\"1600\" height=\"180\" src=\"https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-Ch7IAaI0oHw/WtTYSqlEzsI/AAAAAAAAXeY/4hgRvblarH4m1O13bh8vHAoV7FJZMqlmwCLcBGAs/s320/20180321_203030.jpg\" width=\"320\" /></a></div>Parker had his Spring band concert on Wednesday March 21st.  He was first chair at this concert and got to sit right up front.
