That whole becoming a man thing.  Lo those many lifetimes (and digital clock radios!) ago…  Happened on a Saturday. Under the same (and ever changing) sky.   (Back before the roads lost their way.)  ---   A thought too for my friend B.L.'s mother who passed from this earth 10 years ago today.  ---  Thinking about  the Warriors and Cavs, truth and reconciliation, the \"here\" and \"now,\" being and time, identity and difference, logos and law, image and word, forgiveness and love, deckchairs and Titanics, picks and pops....  Trying to find refuge in the present.

I don't even think the younger Lebron makes that shot.  He has done so much impressive work on his body and his game over the years.  I think he's playing the best basketball of his life right now.  And perhaps the best basketball ever played.  In any event, he has more than legitimized the MJ-LBJ GOAT debate...if one is inclined to designate GOATs.   Other hoopic thoughts.  I love that someone once pointed out that Klay Thompson is the only NBA player who is completely indistinguishabe from his NBA 2K avatar.  Love that guy.  (Coinciding perfectly with one's simulacrum...)  The name of the game is keeping the mind off the worry and the pain.     What worry?  What pain?   (In Spain...falls softly on the...)  ---   There is no way to be prepared for or commensurate with it.    It is all beyond vertiginous once you get ahead of yourself.   One step at a time.  (As a wise man once said, it's the only way to walk.)  ---   More hoops?  Um...Um...Ok...if you insist.  Um...really hoping the Dubs can exhibit some greatness on Sunday.  Or that LeBron puts them on a poster...and exposes them as the arrogant, lazy, entiitled two time champs they just might be...In any event, I want to see greatness.  And more JaVale McGee!    Oh and someone (Zach Lowe?) suggested that that Steph pass to teammate then sprint to corner to get return pass for the three needs a name.  The Three Step Three? The Three Steph?  The Steph and fetch it?  The give 'n shiv? The dash 'n splash? The Stephdango?   Blessed are the phonemes.  Blessed are the distractions.     Blessed is the sustaining silliness...and the spirit that enables it.   ---   BTW:  It appears that half day of racial sensitivity training has helped at Starbucks. So far, I have not heard anyone say the N word.  And I have seen no one call the cops on black patrons.  (Of course, in fairness, I have not seen any black patrons.)    Oh wait...there was one ordering a tall flat white. (Legit.)  ---   Random debris:   He could not live in stories.  And that was his problem.  (But he found his ways to connect.)  ---  Elsewhere, the banker was being inadvertently Derridean. There was a lot of disagreement as to whether he could officially notarize the document.   Especially in his role as himself.  As usual, I flubbed the signature.  The answer to the question \"Can I get a witness?\" turned out to be no.    Everyone, it seemed, had a row to hoe, an ax to grind or a cross to bear. But no one had a clue. And frankly very few really wanted to know.    We are all finding our own ways to be ordinary and awesome. Power to the people. Pronouns are us.     What Will be Will be.   ---  Breathe with dignity. Death with dignity.  ---    Banish the impostor.   Heal the breach.    (Take the Klonopin.)   ---  45 years ago at this very hour, I was was eating a \"parfait\" (I remember being impressed by the word)  at my post bar mitzvah party, wearing my yellow shirt, blue blazer and red pants, hearing my grandfather and father give sweet, semi drunken toasts.. And, smiling through my shiny new braces,  I was preparing to slow dance with some girls who were like a head taller than me...(The two Ruths, Lori, Ellen, Beth, Liz....)  ---  As hard as things are, it is nice to be in narratable space for a change.  ---   Another version of recursion. Another iced coffee through a straw.  ---   What worry?  What pain??? All's well that ends.  ---   Come what may, I feel graced and grateful to have had this moment...of (at least some) peace and presence and selfhood.  To see the sundry sights and to have the random thoughts and to scribble in your general direction.    I thank you all for the real and imaginary companionship.  No one can ever take that away.  Peace. ","contentWithMarkup":"<div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both;\"><a href=\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-QE90slOMKR0/WxLrCPBzsHI/AAAAAAAAKmc/xZX_B-GqTe4NQKDXH_2-lR-BtPwh9f01ACHMYCw/s640/blogger-image--2009758776.jpg\" style=\"margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-QE90slOMKR0/WxLrCPBzsHI/AAAAAAAAKmc/xZX_B-GqTe4NQKDXH_2-lR-BtPwh9f01ACHMYCw/s640/blogger-image--2009758776.jpg\" /></a></div><span style=\"font-family: \"times\" , \"times new roman\" , serif; font-size: small;\">In the meantime...<br /><br />Really don't know if that end of Friday call from the doctor will turn out to have been good news or bad news.
