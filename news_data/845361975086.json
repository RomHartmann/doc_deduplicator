Buffalo Wild Wings is the latest victim of a Twitter hacktivist after the sports bar franchise’s official Twitter page fired off several racist and vulgar tweets Friday night.    The tweets contained many hateful, racist comments, derogatory terms and sexual references. A particularly vulgar post claimed that their secret wing recipe used semen. The anonymous hacker also posted a vile joke directed at Wendy’s.      New recipe in the sauce? Too much ranch? #Buffalowildwings  @BWWings  pic.twitter.com/bNo9QRPkr8    — airplane pt 2 (@x_anchez) June 1, 2018         One included a bizarre and racially charged reminder that Madeleine McCann has been missing for nearly a decade. McCann is an English girl who went missing in Portugal when she was 3-years-old in 2007.    Another post attacked film producer and writer Tariq Nasheed with a racial slur. Nasheed tweeted screenshots of the tweet saying he didn’t know if the account had been hacked or not but he wants an apology, according to NBC Chicago .    Twitter user Parker Molloy retweeted the offensive posts shortly after they went live, asking BWW: “Everything okay over there guys ….?”      Everything okay over there, guys…? pic.twitter.com/Yneor0pnPi    — Parker Molloy (@ParkerMolloy) June 1, 2018           #BuffaloWildWings PR team will be working some long hours this weekend… pic.twitter.com/5KhaLtq2Iy    — Bio Stocks™ (@BioStocks) June 2, 2018         “Buffalo Wild Wings’ Twitter account was hacked,” a spokesperson for the company said in an emailed statement. “We’re sorry that our fans had to see those awful posts, which obviously did not come from us. We are in touch with our Twitter representatives and will pursue the appropriate action against the individuals involved.”    The messages apparently went unnoticed by BWW social media management for close to 20 minutes after the hacktivist started flooding the account. The Twitter account is back to normal and any activity from the past 6 hours has been deleted.    Although it isn’t clear who the culprit as of yet, but one tweet posted by the hacker contained a picture of a man with his face partially covered up, according to TMZ.  There is speculation that this may be the man responsible for hacking the account, but BWW hasn’t confirmed.
