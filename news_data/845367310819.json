He was initially told he had only seven months to live, but Banat – from Sydney, Australia – eventually survived for more than two years longer than doctors predicted. He passed awayearlier this week, but the philanthropist and former businessman has spent the last few years raising money for underprivileged Muslims around the world, while also battling his terminal illness.  In the years prior to his diagnosis, Banat lived a luxurious life filled with fast cars, expensive clothing and countless other material possessions, but once he realised he was sick, he said he realised he had been chasing the wrong goals.  In a short documentary uploaded to YouTube channel OnePath Network, Ali describes his illness as a “gift”.  When questioned on his choice of language, he responds:  “It’s a gift because Allah has given me a chance to change.”  Upon receiving his diagnosis, Banat immediately sold his business and travelled to Togo, Africa, a country in which approximately 55 per cent of the population lives below the poverty line. Things have, however, improved since 2008, when UNICEF reported 80 per cent living in poverty.
