Friday, teachers and students held an end-of-the-year bash to celebrate the school's legacy.    Marcy Huber has a special connection to this building.    \"I went to K.M. Smith Elementary in the 70's. So I've gone to school here and I've been a teacher here for the past 20 years. So it's really special. It's the end of an era for sure.
