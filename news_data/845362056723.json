Keep in mind that weather patterns can be extreme at this time of year, introducing new safety hazards. Get weather-ready in the following ways.    Prepare for the Heat    When planning a day outdoors, most people pack items such as sunscreen, sunglasses and a hat. However, summer heat can be dangerous if you’re not prepared, so consider the following: make sure your vehicle’s air conditioning is in good working order well before a trip, have a rain umbrella on hand to shield you from the sun, as well as frozen water bottles and instant cold packs that can help cool you down quickly. Lastly, make sure you have plenty of water on hand when traveling with pets, and be sure to keep them out of unattended cars where temperatures can quickly reach fatal levels.    Know What’s Coming    Before heading to the pool or packing that picnic lunch, check the weather report to make smart decisions about where the day will carry you.

Don’t Be Bugged    Take precautions against bug bites, particularly mosquitoes, which can be carriers of the Zika virus. Experts are warning that those located in or traveling to the southern United States should take precautions to guard against the disease, especially if you are already or planning on getting pregnant.    Be sure your backyard is drained of standing water. Use citronella candles to ward off bugs. Apply insect repellent on hikes and other times you’re in buggy areas, and if possible, avoid skin exposure during dusk, when mosquitoes are most active.         If you’re looking to travel this summer, check out AccuWeather’s first-of-its-kind Mosquito Zika Risk Index in advance, which gives users an easy way to view the likelihood of mosquito infestations that could lead to greater risk of contracting the Zika virus within the contiguous U.S. This new interactive Index, available now on AccuWeather.com , as well as the AccuWeather app on iOS and Android, showcases a week-by-week risk index for the next seven weeks that can help you make more informed decisions to stay out of harm’s way.    With a little preparation, you can make the most of the summer and your travel plans by dodging common weather risks and hazards.
