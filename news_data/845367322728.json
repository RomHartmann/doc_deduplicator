According to deputies, they found Bonner at a red light, and pulled alongside of the car.

Authorities said he was treated at Halifax Health Medical Center for injuries inflicted by the K-9.    Deputies said Bonner told them he didn't think the dog would find him.    Authorities found a 4-year-old in the front seat of the stolen vehicle without a child restraint seat or a seat belt.
