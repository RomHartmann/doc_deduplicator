In the letter, the Trump's lawyers argue that a charge of illegal obstruction is moot because the Constitution empowers the president to, \"if he wished, terminate the inquiry, or even exercise his power to pardon.\"  \r   \tTrump weighed in on Saturday on Twitter, asking \"Is the Special Counsel/Justice Department leaking my lawyers letters to the Fake News Media?\" He added: \"When will this very expensive Witch Hunt Hoax ever end? So bad for our Country.\"  \r   \tMueller has requested an interview with the president to determine whether he had criminal intent to obstruct the investigation into his associates' possible links to Russia's election interference. Trump had previously signaled that he would be willing to sit for an interview, but his legal team, including head lawyer Rudy Giuliani, have privately and publicly expressed concern that the president could risk charges of perjury.  \r   \tIf Trump does not consent to an interview, Mueller will have to decide whether to forge forward with a historic grand jury subpoena. His team raised the possibility in March of subpoenaing the president but it is not clear if it is still under active consideration.
