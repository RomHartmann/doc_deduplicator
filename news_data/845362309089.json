National Oilwell Varco (NOV) introduced the TrackerVision system, a new augmented-reality wearable technology that brings together software, communication devices, and special hardware to increase the effectiveness of service technicians on land rigs and offshore vessels. The technology is part of the company's Rig Technologies portfolio. The system aims to bridge the gap between the field and the office, addressing challenges such as safety risks and communications-related downtime and reducing or eliminating the need to send additional service technicians to the site. Service technicians equipped with the TrackerVision system can stream real-time audio and video, allowing subject matter experts at global service centers to view events in the field and provide the service technician with hands-free collaboration, guidance, and streamlined troubleshooting. TrackerVision uses a self-contained internet connection--which includes end-to-end encryption to ensure sensitive operational data is protected--that is not dependent upon the rig’s internet connection.
