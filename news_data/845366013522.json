She also pledged retraining for any laid off steelworkers if the tariffs persist.    The Liberal leader lashed out at Horwath Friday morning during a Dundas campaign stop. Wynne says Horwath, the Ontario NDP leader who's represented Hamilton Centre, seemed to blame the Liberals for the tariffs.    She also seemed to not know Wynne had met with 37 U.S. government leaders to advocate for Canada's steel industry, Wynne claimed. And that is \"not good enough.\"    \"It is not an adequate response for someone who is saying that she is ready to be the premier of the province, six days before the election,\" Wynne said.    Former Liberal cabinet minister Ted McMeekin, candidate for Hamilton West-Ancaster-Dundas, called Horwath's statement \"embarrassing\" given that she's from a labour party and a steel town.      Horwath's statement doesn't specifically blame Wynne for the tariffs. It also doesn't say that Wynne hasn't met with 37 governors, as well as senators and other top U.S. officials. Rather, it says Horwath would do the same.     \"The first job for (the new premier) must be to take an active role in resolving this conflict, undoing the damage and getting Ontario's steel and aluminum industries back on the rails,\" Horwath said in an emailed statement Thursday.    \"If I am elected premier, I'll be meeting with Canadian and American officials immediately to do everything I can to secure an exemption to these punitive, devastating tariffs.\"    Ontario PC leader Doug Ford, meanwhile, said the tariffs will \"make things even harder for Ontario's already struggling steel industry and our workers.\"    As premier, he said in a statement, he will work with the federal government to \"resolve these trade issues and make Ontario open for business again.\"    Wynne said Friday that if tariffs persist, a Liberal government would provide training, education and advocacy for displaced steelworkers.    Some believe the tariffs are temporary, and a way to give the U.S. a leg up in NAFTA negotiations. Wynne said Canada can't count on that.    \"There are a lot of moving parts in this, and we can't just hold our breath and assume all of this will be gone in a few months because there will be a NAFTA deal,\" she said. \"There are way too many questions about that path to a resolution of NAFTA for us to do that.\"    It was Wynne's second stop in Hamilton this week alone. At Stelco on Wednesday, she  took aim at Horwath  again, implying the NDP is too ideological to participate in trade talks.    The NDP said Horwath is able and prepared to do that, and called taking part in the talks \"the bare minimum\" of a premier's job.    The election is June 7. Polling shows the NDP to be leading the popular vote, but trailing the PC party in seats.","contentWithMarkup":"Kathleen Wynne is slamming what she describes as Andrea Horwath's \"inadequate\" response to the U.S. government's new tariffs on Canadian steel.
