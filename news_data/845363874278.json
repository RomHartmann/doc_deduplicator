WalletHub also found the Charleston area falls into one of the lowest rankings for mortgage debt, thanks to a median home loan balance of $95,607, a $153,000 median house value and midpoint income of $46,758. The mortgage debt-to-income ratio of 204 percent fits in the fifth lowest grouping of borrower payments and the 62 percent mortgage debt-to-house value ratio places 15th lowest.    The personal finance website rolled out its 2018 Home Overleverage Report as \"mortgage rates (are ) slowly climbing but still low, and demand for homes exceeding supply.\"    WalletHub compared the median mortgage debt with the midpoint income and home value in more than 2,500 U.S. cities, \"in order to determine where homeowners have the most unsustainable mortgage debts.\" Willis, Texas, north of Houston ranked the most over-leveraged city in the nation, while Bronxville, New York, northeast of Manhattan faces the least daunting mortgage bills.
