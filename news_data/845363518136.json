Sophie Hollins is 6'2\" and can touch the ceilings at her Southampton home and is roughly 18 inches taller than most of her classmates. Guinness World Records reckon that 12-year-old Sophie is the world's tallest pre-teen. She said: “I’ve always known I was different. I’ve been tallest in my class from day one.” And while Sophie sometimes enjoys her unusual height, she adds that she will be delighted if a recent procedure to stunt her growth is successful. © Helen Yates/Platform Press Related: Record-breaking human bodies from around the world That's amazing: Record-breaking human bodies from around the world Sophie was diagnosed with Marfan syndrome at eight months and looks down on her 5'10\" dad Ian, 5'4\" mum Lorraine, both 44, and her 4'7\" brother Aaron, 10. The life-threatening genetic disorder affects the body’s connective tissues causing organ problems or leading to extreme height. At six years old Sophie was 4'10\", four years later she was 5'11\" and doctors have attempted to curb her surge in height by destroying growth tissues in her knees and giving her hormones to speed up puberty. © Helen Yates/Platform Press © Helen Yates/Platform Press She said: “Mum told me about Marfan syndrome when I was little. It’s who I am. I’m proud of that. “But I’m happy I might have finished growing. It’s cool to be 6ft 2in but I don’t want to be much taller. “Now my friends are starting to catch up. The last few years have been tough with everything my body has been through.  \"But I’m happy it’s over and am excited about becoming a teenager.” Dental receptionist Lorraine said: “I always told Sophie people are going to stare. © Helen Yates/Platform Press © Helen Yates/Platform Press \"Boys at school called her a giraffe. There was a time she was so skinny I feared her legs would snap in half.” Guinness says the world tallest man is Turkish farmer Sultan Kösen, 35, at 8ft 2.8in.
