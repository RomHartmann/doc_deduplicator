This LED light kit consists of ten LED work lights – four spot configured lights and six flood configured lights. This light package provides operators with 21,000 lumens of light and a powerful and versatile LED tractor lighting system upgrade.  The LLP-CAT-TR-C75E LED Tractor Light Package comes with 10 LEDEQ-3X2-CPR LED Work Lights. Four of the light heads come with a spot beam configuration for use as back top cab (2) and front fender (2; right & left) spot beam lights. The LLP-CAT-TR-C75E LED Light Package is ideal for installation and use on a CAT Challenger 75E Tractor. Each LEDEQ-3X2-CPR produces 2,100 lumens of high-intensity LED light output with low voltage and amp draw, a 50,000 hour rated service life and 9 to 42 volt compatibility that provides operators with a versatile and powerful LED tractor lighting solution. The LLP-CAT-TR-C75E LED light package comes with a total of ten LED lights - two lights in a spot configuration to replace top cab lights, two lights in a spot configuration to replace front fender lights, and six remaining lights in a flood configuration to replace front fender and back top cab flood lights. Each LED lamp produces 2,100 lumens, for a total of 21,000 lumens of brilliant, intense LED illumination. Drawing just 300 watts, this lighting package is highly efficient and effective.  This lighting package operates on 9-64V DC input and an electric current of 2.8 amps (per lamp). Each LED lamp in this light kit is IP67 waterproof with an air breather design, sealed against the potential intrusion of dust and dirt, which is highly likely to be found at worksites these lights will be used. Built with aluminum housing and polycarbonate lenses to protect the LEDS, these lights can survive rugged outdoor use and demanding use. Each lamp is mounted via a trunnion u-bracket mount making vertical adjustments easy.  “The LLP-CAT-TR-C75E is an ideal replacement kit for traditional tractor lights that aren’t bright enough and waste too much energy,” said Rob Bresnahan, CEO of Larson Electronics LLC. “These CREE LED lights are excellent energy-efficient upgrades, and are designed for direct replacement, so upgrading existing lights is very simple.”  About Larson Electronics LLC: Larson Electronics LLC is a manufacturer of industrial lighting equipment and accessories.
