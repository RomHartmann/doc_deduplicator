{"sequenceId":"845366450469","id":"34207242495","language":"English","title":"Letter to editor: Support LGBT community","content":"I am writing today to bring attention to Representative Eric Roe’s (PA-158) dismal record regarding our LGBT community.    In June 2017, the PA House of Representatives voted 182-11 in favor of a resolution designating June as LGBT Pride month in the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania. This bipartisan, overwhelming show of support was a testimony to how far Pennsylvania has come in recognizing that all members of our community deserve respect and acceptance.    However, as a constituent of Rep. Roe’s 158th district, I found it shocking and disappointing that Rep. Roe was one of those 11 votes against this resolution. PA’s 158th is a moderate district full of compassionate citizens of all parties. Rep. Roe’s conservative vote, far to the extreme right even of House Speaker Turzai, who voted in favor of the resolution, suggests that Rep. Roe does not understand that he has a responsibility to represent his constituents, not himself.    Apparently Rep. Roe, himself, does not support his LGBT constituents.      During the month of June, as members of my family celebrate LGBT Pride month, we will also be urging constituents of PA-158 to understand they have a choice this fall. In November, instead of voting for Rep. Roe and reaffirming his disappointing views on LGBT rights, we can vote for moderate Christina Sappey, who will represent all the people of PA-158.    I plan to vote my values and urge PA-158 constituents (Avondale, East Bradford, East Marlborough, London Britain, New Garden, Newlin, West Bradford, West Goshen (part) and West Marlborough) to do the same.
