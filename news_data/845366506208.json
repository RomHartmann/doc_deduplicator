The watch includes Charleston, Berkeley, Dorchester, Beaufort, Colleton, Hampton, Jasper and Allendale Counties. Click for instant severe weather alerts and forecast videos.  A severe thunderstorm watch means conditions could favor the formation of severe thunderstorms.  “The main concern will be damaging winds, hail, and downpours,” says Live 5 Meteorologist Stephanie Sine. “Once we lose the heat of the day, the chance of thunderstorms throughout the night will go down.”  Forecasters say showers and thunderstorms could impact Southeast South Carolina into the evening. A few of these thunderstorms could become severe with large hail and damaging winds.  In addition to severe weather, there will be a risk for locally heavy rainfall capable of producing minor flooding of low lying and poor drainage areas and frequent cloud to ground lightning.","contentWithMarkup":"The National Weather Service issued a severe thunderstorm watch for most Lowcountry counties until 8 p.m. Saturday.
