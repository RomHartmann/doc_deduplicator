Liechty said the total was 1,500 more people than last year and doubled the 2016 event.     After anticipating 4,500 people to attend this year's festival, Liechty said he was proud of the staff and volunteers who adjusted and responded to the high turnout.     \"It's a perfect day,\" Liechty said. \"It's great seeing so many people in the community at the museum.
