I am writing on behalf of the Texas Democratic Women of Rural North Texas of which I am the president.    We established a scholarship, the Tracy A. Smith Memorial Scholarship Fund, so that a deserving student could receive assistance in attending college. The qualifications are as follows: female permanent resident of a rural county in North Texas attending an accredited college or university; have a grade point average of 2.5 or above; enroll as a full-time student; demonstrate financial need; be available for interview.    On May 19, we were proud to award $1,000 to first recipient, Zoe Klement. She will be attending Oklahoma State University. Zoe is an officer in the FCCLA, UIL one-act play, National Honor Society, member of Sacred Heart Catholic Parish youth group and currently serves as a Eucharistic minister, works with Keep Muenster Beautiful, works part-time at a local bakery and convenience store and takes dual-credit college courses at NCTC. As you can see, Zoe is a very busy lady. After college she has plans to return to Muenster or a rural area to open a business and apply what she has learned. Zoe was an exceptional interview, never having to think of an answer, and knew exactly what she wanted. Our group looks forward to the great things she will do in the future.    If you are interested in giving to the scholarship go to our web page: tdwofruralnorthtexas.com . We are looking forward to see what next year’s student brings.
