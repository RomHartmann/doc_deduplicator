{"sequenceId":"845362106765","id":"34207108063","language":"English","title":"At the library: There’s something for everyone this summer","content":"I appear to be stuck on a theme lately of talking up all the programs we have to offer at our various branches. In my defense, I am a librarian and I like to think we have something to offer for everyone (and if we don't have something for you, then you should let us know so that we can get to work on that).    The Child Seat Check event at our Central Library is taking place on June 16 from 10 a.m. to 1 p.m. The Louisiana Passenger Safety Task Force is partnering with us to offer free child seat inspections. This is a great opportunity for new parents, grandparents, and child-care workers to make sure they've got their child seats properly secured.    Bossier Central is also offering a class for kitchen beginners called \"Basics of the Kitchen\" on June 18 at 2 p.m.; and on June 26 they'll host a clinic on civil legal issues during which you can speak with an attorney about a wide range of matters. And teens can attend \"Playing for Keeps\" financial literacy sessions, led by Ms. Yvonne Bartly to learn how money really works.    And remember, you can also catch us out in the community at the Bossier Farmer's Market on June 9 or at R.W. Norton Art Gallery's Twilight Talkie featuring “101 Dalmatians” on June 15!    Make a note:    • The History Center is closed through June 6 for air conditioning work. End date subject to change, please call or check our website for more up-to-date information.
