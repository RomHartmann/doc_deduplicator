Orlando, Florida - Time is something to be spent with friends over great food and drink – especially at The Glass Knife.  Located in the heart of Orlando's Winter Park neighborhood, It has quickly become a go-to destination in Central Florida as a sleek yet approachable haven for those in search of both sweet and savory.    The Glass Knife is a community gathering place that encourages togetherness and celebration.  The food served evokes familiar family recipes handed down over time, but created with their culinary team’s unique twist and presentation. It is more than a bakery, but rather a truly unique dining experience - featuring the perfect combination of sweet and savory, no matter the time of day.    Start the day with scratch-made, small batch Orlando donuts , an avocado and egg toast, or a cheddar biscuit sandwich – just a few of their morning offerings. The Glass Knife also brings its Guests’ everyday coffee routine to the next level with two firsts for Central Florida – an exclusive brewing partnership with Onyx Coffee Lab, a celebrated, one-of-a-kind coffee roaster; and, the installation of Modbar’s suite of cutting-edge brewing systems.    Lunch and evening standouts include the Roasted Turkey Club sandwich, the Berry Bacon Spinach Salad or even a Chicken Pot Pie. Available all day, enjoy a variety of cake selections, including Southern red velvet or carrot cake, or even European-style pastries and The Glass Knife Orlando specialty desserts along with an always-changing selection of fine wines, craft beers, and champagne.    “Today I had my first dining experience at The Glass Knife. Wow, the food is delicious!” said Cheri Benedetti, in her Google review. “The Berry Bacon Spinach Salad with bacon Dijon vinaigrette is amazing! The dessert presentations are lovely and very impressive, not to mention they are delicious! Finally, the customer service is excellent, and the decor is so well thought out and elegant for a casual, counter-service cafe bakery setting. If you have not been here yet, you must go and experience it! You will not be disappointed!”    The Glass Knife is a counter-service, cash-free and smoke-free establishment and is open from 7am to 10pm daily, with seating inside or on their covered, pet-friendly patio.
