BUTTE, Mont. —    Forest officials are warning people to be bear aware this summer, especially since human-bear encounters are on the rise.    Visitor information assistant Sarah Rowley made that point clear Friday: \"It's a two-fold, maybe a three-fold issue. More people, more bears and more urban interface areas means more opportunities for them to encounter each other.\"    She warns campers bears can be anywhere.    \"The occupy forested areas, open areas. They're constantly searching for food,\" Rowley said.    She said bears’ food sources are big clues where they might be in Montana’s national parks.    Rowley adds grizzlies and black bears are up to capacity in those areas and are looking for new homes. That's why it's also common to see bears in national forests.    She stressed important tips to campers.    \"Making noise is helpful. I think traveling in groups is pretty key,\" Rowley said.    Having the right equipment is also crucial.    Forest Service officials tell NBC Montana it's important to have a bear-resistant container when storing food. It needs to be sturdy enough that bears can't pry their claws into it. That's why bolting sides of the container is important.    Of course don't forget the bear spray.
