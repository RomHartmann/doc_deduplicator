As Muslims we do not need any mediators between us and Allah. In this article we will highlight some supplications that were mentioned in the Qur’an and the Sunnah of the Prophet, sallallaahu ‘alaihi wa sallam. Allah Says (what means): “Our Lord, condemn us not if we forget or fall into error. Our Lord, lay not on us a burden like that you laid on those before us. Our Lord, lay not on us what we have no strength to bear. Blot out our sins, and forgive us, and have mercy on us, You are our Protector, so give us Your help against the faithless people.” [Qur’an 2:286]  Allah Says (what means): “Our Lord, not for naught have you created that (Heavens and Earth and what is between] Glory be to You, so shield us from the penalty of the Fire. Our Lord, whom you admit to the Fire, you have covered them with shame. Our Lord, forgive us our sins, and blot out from us our iniquities, and gather us with those righteous (in the Hereafter). Our Lord, grant us what you promised us through Your Messengers, and do not shame us on the Day of Resurrection. Truly You, Allah never break Your promise.” [Qur’an 3:191-194]  Allah Says (what means): “Our Lord, You are the Master of the Kingdom, You grant the Kingdom to whom You will, and expropriate the Kingdom from whom You will. You bring honour to whom You will and You let whom You will be disgraced. In Your Hand is all the good, for You are Powerful over everything. You cause the night to gain on the day, and You cause the day to gain on the night. You bring the living out of the dead and You bring the dead out of the living, and You give sustenance to whom You will without measure”. [Qur’an 3:26-27]  Allah Says (what means): “Our Lord, truly You know what we conceal, and what we reveal, and nothing is hidden from Allah whether on Earth or in Heaven”. [Qur’an 14:38]  Allah Says (what means): “Our Lord, forgive my parents and the faithful (people) when, the Day of Judgment comes. Our Lord, avert from us the wrath of Hell, for its wrath is indeed a grievous affliction. It is such a bad place to stay and abide”. [Qur’an 25:65]  Allah Says (what means): “Our Lord, in You we trust, and to You we return in repentance, to You is the destination (of all Your creation).” [Qur’an 60:7].  Allah Says (what means): “Our Lord, forgive us our sins, and anything we may have done that transgressed our duty, and establish our feet firmly (when facing Your enemies) and help us against those that resist faith”. [Qur’an 3:147]   Allah Says (what means): “Our Lord, we have wronged our own souls, and if You do not forgive us, then we are certainly failures (losers).” [Qur’an 7:23]  Allah Says (what means): “Our Lord, bestow on us Mercy from Yourself, and dispose of our affairs for us in the right way”.[Qur’an 18:20]  Allah Says (what means): “Our Lord, we do believe, so forgive us and have mercy on us, for You (Allah) are the most Merciful of any who show mercy”. [Qur’an 23:109]  Allah Says (what means): “Our Lord, Your reach is over all things in mercy and knowledge, so forgive those who repent and follow Your way and preserve them from the torment of the blazing Fire. Our Lord, grant them that they enter Paradise which You have promised them and the righteous of their fathers, and their wives, and their posterity for You are Exalted in might, full of wisdom. And preserve them from ills, for one whom You preserve from ill –on that Day of Judgment – You bestow mercy on him, and that is the supreme success”. [Qur’an 40:7-9]  Allah Says (what means): “Our Lord, let not our hearts deviate after You have guided us, And grant us Mercy from Your own presence, for You are (Allah) Granter of bounties without measure. Our Lord, You are He that will gather all the people together against a day which there is no doubt, for Allah never break his promise”.
