Keri L. Branquinho, 31, of New Bedford, the valedictorian of the Class of 2018, spent a decade in social work. She was a supervisor in a home for behaviorally challenged adolescent girls when she was laid off.    She decided then it was time for college, though she wondered if she would ever belong there.    Scott C. Lyndon, 56, of Fairhaven, the class salutatorian, took an even longer road to BCC.    “I’m a non-traditional student,” he said. “I’m an Air Force veteran. I was a nurse for 25 years.    “I decided it was time for another career.”    Branquinho and Lyndon were two of the 1,680 BCC students who received diplomas Saturday in the 51st commencement ceremonies at the college. It is the largest class to graduate from a community college in the state.    For most of the students, herself included, the hardest part of being a college student was making the decision to start, Branquinho said.    In her valedictory address, she asked students to stand if they were immigrants, disabled, lesbian or gay, older than 25 or raising children. Most of the students were standing when she finished the list.    Branquinho said she was initially reluctant to apply for college, wondering if she could do the work or fit in.    “If I had known BCC would provide such a supportive atmosphere, I wouldn’t have worried about going to college,” she said.    Katie Ruggieri, a professor of biology at BCC, was selected by the students to give the Last Lecture. She said she understood why some of them would be intimidated by college. She was, too.    She applied to teach at BCC three times and was offered a job each time.    “I was so nervous about leaving my job that I turned this job down not once, but twice,” she said.    But, she said, there are benefits to finally taking a risk. After seven years of teaching, she said, “I love what I do.”    So she learned firsthand the advice she offered:    “Fake it 'til you make it,” she said. “Bring just a tad more confidence to the table than you currently possess.”    Outside the tent that held the commencement, families gathered for pictures with new graduates. Former classmates crossed paths, talking about the next chapter of their lives — college, work or a new career.    Branquinho was heading to Bridgewater for a degree in social work. Lyndon was going on UMass Dartmouth for a master’s degree in psychology. For Kylie Pasternak, the student trustee on the college board of trustees, her engineering degree allowed her an internship with University of Rhode Island professor Robert Ballard, the man who found the wreck of the Titanic. Pasternak will be part of a team exploring the ocean floor off the coast of California.    Varied paths lead students to BCC. They will take varied paths away, said Laura C. Douglas, who was participating in her first BCC commencement since being named college president.    She congratulated the students first for overcoming the obstacles many faced in their path to college.    “Whether you see yourself as Iron Man, Wonder Woman or Black Panther, I’m sure you made heroic efforts to juggle challenges to come here,” she said.    “It takes a superhero to navigate life’s obstacles.”    Email Kevin P.
