Mayor Kyle Moore said the funding in place will allow for long-needed improvements at the facility that has seen multiple outbreaks of Legionnaires' disease since 2015.    \"Now that we are here and the first phase of funding is in place, we look forward to further collaboration, as we know that there is much work to be done to finish the job to serve generations of veterans to come,\" Moore said.    Moore and other members of the Bipartisan Quincy Veterans Home Steering Committee discussed the funding during a press conference Saturday in Washington Park.    Gov. Bruce Rauner has called for the complete reconstruction of the Illinois Veterans Home at a cost of more than $200 million, which the state could qualify for a 65 percent reimbursement from the federal government. The plan calls for a new 250- to 300-bed nursing care building along with a new water distribution plumbing loop.    This came after the state spent $6.4 million on water treatment upgrades at the home to combat Legionella.    Thirteen residents and dozens more have been sickened by Legionnaires' disease in the outbreaks.    Rauner has pledged to sign the budget overwhelmingly approved last week by the General Assembly.    Moore said the committee worked to take partisanship out of the discussion on how to best care and support veterans and help formulate a plan to eradicate Legionella on campus.    Former mayors Chuck Scholz and C. David Nuessen both noted the bipartisan support of moving forward on the project in Springfield.    \"We're just thrilled to see it,\" Scholz said.    \"State legislators and state senators came to Quincy to look at the facility,\" Nuessen said. \"We had a problem and they came to find out about the problem and what they could do about the problem.\"    Former state Rep. Mike McClain said the funds will allow for the purchase and renovation of Sycamore Healthcare, 720 Sycamore, as a temporary facility.    \"Residents who are in some of those older buildings will get moved there,\" McClain said. \"It will look like almost a brand new facility for them.\"    Possible plans for Sycamore Healthcare after the construction of a new facility on the campus include a mental health facility for veterans.    The funds will also allow for construction of the new water loop    McClain also said temporary changes to the state procurement code for the Veterans Home will allow for improvements to start earlier than a typical state project.    State Sen. Jil Tracy, R-Quincy, said the residents and staff at the Veterans Home convinced visiting lawmakers to invest in it.    \"They convinced everybody, once they visited it, how special that place is, and our community of Quincy is part of the Veterans Home and vice versa,\" Tracy said. \"We're so happy that the tradition that has begun there will continue for our veterans.\"","contentWithMarkup":"Posted: Jun. 2, 2018 4:00 pm    QUINCY -- The $53 million earmarked for the Illinois Veterans Home in Quincy is being lauded by local officials.
