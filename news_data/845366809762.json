Many commercial cleaners contain isothiazolinone preservatives which trigger or exacerbate allergies    Most contain chemicals that cause respiratory issues and ill effects – particularly all purpose cleaners    Some contain ingredients that are associated with developmental, endocrine or reproductive harm    Most contain perfume or fragrances that lead to reproductive or developmental issues    Some refer to these perfumes or fragrances as essential oil when they are in fact, fake fragrances    Some contain chemicals linked to cancer, anemia and bone marrow damage   Most Notable…   Lung damage is linked to national brand cleaning products!!!    In a 20 year completely independent longitudinal study of both men and women who used spray and liquid cleaning products in their home and had lung capacity tested regularly, the following was found.    Weekly use of commercial cleaning products  is as damaging to lung health as smoking 20 cigarettes per day  Women were affected more than men which is of particular concern since women use cleaning products more than men  This shows that cleaning at home is just as harmful as being a commercial cleaner and perhaps even more harmful  Liquid cleaners are just as dangerous as sprays  Dangerous chemicals include:  ammonia, chlorine bleach, and quaternary disinfecting compounds  Women have increased rates of asthma  The damage is cumulative over time   What Can You Do To Protect Yourself?
