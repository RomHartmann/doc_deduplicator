A huge police presence kept the two sides apart as speakers at the St Peter's Square rally condemned the DFLA, including Dan Hett, whose brother, Martin, was killed in the Arena bombing. Dan Hett, whose brother Martin was killed in the Manchester Arena bombing, slammed the Democratic Football Lads Alliance (DFLA) this afternoon, as around one thousand of its supporters marched from All Saints to the Castlefield bowl in Manchester.  Dan, who was speaking at the counter demonstration in St Peter's Square, organised by Stand Up To Racism and Unite Against Fascism, slated the DFLA for 'disrespect' and 'spreading hatred'...  \"We're still dealing with this as a city and it is the greatest disrespect for them to come and spout hatred in the way that they are doing\" he said \"Ask them, 'What are you actually doing about extremism, please be specific'...I have had not one decent response from these people.  \"They are doing nothing about extremism but spreading hatred in the name of fighting extremism and that is utterly unacceptable\" he added.  Other speakers joined his condemnation of the DFLA, including Mike from Stand Up To Racism...   \"Islamaphobia is being used right across Europe as a rallying cry for the far right, and it is absolutely the same as the treatment of the Jews\" he said \"When you get a situation where, in the USA, migrants at holding centres are told to wear yellow armbands by Donald Trump we know where this shit ends up – it ends up with Auschwitz, Treblinka and the rest of it...  \"These bastards are trying to use the families and the dead of those attacks in order to build a far right street movement; it's disgraceful\" he added \"It's not part of working class culture to be a racist shit bag. It's not part of football culture, it's not part of the culture of any of our cities and towns. We have to create a proper movement – they have to be met by the majority...\"  From Salford UNISON, Ameen Hadi, slammed the DFLA allying itself with football...  \"I find the whole tag around football confusing\" he said \"If anyone looks at any football team in this country it would be difficult to find a team that doesn't have any black players, Muslims, Asians...which team do they support?   \"Yet they claim to represent football supporters\" he added \"No, they represent a very small band of racist, fascist football supporters who are intent on violence. That's why it's so important we're here today to oppose them. Without us being here they would be able to walk the streets freely; they would be able to terrorise communities freely, and feel they were legitimate. We cannot allow that to happen...\"  While the DFLA marched, surrounded by a heavy police presence, the counter rally in St Peter's Square included songs, and verse by Salford poet Rob Dunford...  'And the so sad eyes of uncertain times  Where's the Lowry to record the lives of bankers and their global crimes  Tax dodging corporates with flimsy fines  They blight my northern town  Where it's pushing care in the community  But where's the care for the community?  As government grants cut with typical Tory impunity   If we fight amongst ourselves in an orgy of disunity  It envelopes our northern town...'","contentWithMarkup":"Star date: 2nd June 2018   DFLA KEPT FROM MANCHESTER CITY CENTRE BY PROTESTERS  \"It is the greatest disrespect for them to come and spout hatred in the way that they are doing...\" Dan Hett   Around one thousand far right Democratic Football Lads Alliance (DFLA) supporters were kept from marching through Manchester City Centre this afternoon by a counter demonstration from Stand Up To Racism and Unite Against Fascism in St Peter's Square.
