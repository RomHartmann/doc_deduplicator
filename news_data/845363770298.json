Due to heat and ozone warnings, Sonflower Camp will be moved indoors to the Crossroads Church in Decatur 9 a.m. to noon Monday through Wednesday. There’s no camp Thursday. Swim day is 12:30 to 1:30 p.m. Friday at Fit-N-Wise.    There will be crafts, games, stories and live music for the campers and plenty of opportunities to get involved for volunteers. Campers and volunteers can register at sonflowercamp.com .       #2: SEE THE CINDERELLA    Does your little one love Cinderella?    The princess’ story will be brought to life through dance next weekend at “Cinderella and the Glass Slipper,” a ballet performed by the dancers of Wise Ballet and Music Academy at the Decatur High School Theater.    More than 100 dancers, ages 3 to adult, will take to the stage in two performances – 7 p.m. June 9 and 3 p.m. June 10. Tickets should be available at the door, but to guarantee a seat, buy them online at tututix.com/tickets .       #3: DON’T GO HUNGRY    If you, or someone you know, needs help keeping tummies full this summer, check out Feeding Wise Kids. The group is distributing food every week now through Aug. 10 at the following locations and times on Fridays: (Boyd) First United Methodist Church 10:30 to 11 a.m.; (Bridgeport) Cates Street Baptist Church 10:30 to 11 a.m., First Baptist Church 10:30 to 11 a.m., First United Methodist Church 10:30 to 11 a.m., Presbyterian Church 10:30 to 11 a.m.; (Slidell) Slidell High School 8 a.m. to 3 p.m. Other locations and times are 9:30 a.m. to 1:30 p.m. on Wednesdays at the First United Methodist Church in Chico, and Chisholm Trail Middle School and Seven Hills Elementary in Rhome on Thursdays.       #4: BAIT A HOOK    The All-American Fishing Derby promises fun for the whole family – hook, line and sinker.    The annual event, put on by Decatur Rotary Club, is June 9 at Black Creek Lake on the Lyndon B. Johnson National Grasslands. Registration is at 7:30 a.m., and fishing is 8 to 11.    There are three age groups: 1 to 7 years old, 8 to 12, and 13 to 17. Prizes will be awarded in each division for largest fish, most fish and smallest fish. It’s a catch-and-release derby, so that means no fish to clean. (See, it really is fun for the whole family, even mom and dad.)    Also, a free hot dog lunch will be served. If you need information, call 940-627-5475.       #5: RIDE ALL NIGHT    Cool off after dark at Northwest OHV Park next weekend.    The park, along with Bridgeport Parks and Recreation, is hosting an all-night ride June 9 into June 10, a twist on their usual off-road fare. The park will open at 8 a.m. June 9 and remain open until 7 p.m. June 10. Cost is the daily fee, plus $15 to stay Saturday night and Sunday.    The park is at 2914 S. State Highway 101 in Bridgeport.","contentWithMarkup":"<p><img src=\"http://www.wcmessenger.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Sonflower.jpg\" alt=\"Sonflower\" title=\"Sonflower.jpg\" border=\"0\" width=\"580\" height=\"314\" /></p>\n<p><b>#1: SONFLOWER TURNS 20</b></p>\n<p>Sonflower Camp, a free camp for those with special needs, celebrates its 20th anniversary this year – and you’re invited to the party.</p>\n<p>Due to heat and ozone warnings, Sonflower Camp will be moved indoors to the Crossroads Church in Decatur 9 a.m. to noon Monday through Wednesday.
