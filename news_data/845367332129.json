Because you are likely to only use these from time to time, you will need the packaging to keep them clean and dust free while they are stored away. Dust can cause the jets (supplies gas to the burner) in some gas appliances to stop working properly if they become clogged. You can seal the box with some tape to prevent the flaps from lifting/opening.     If your appliances need to be repaired, it’s best to let a qualified technician look at them.    Elcon Gaz is the leading supplier of Industrial and LP Gas to the industry in KZN. Their customers include companies in the Manufacturing, Steel Fabrication, General Engineering, Construction, Transport & Hospitality industries.
