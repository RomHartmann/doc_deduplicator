{"sequenceId":"845364086879","id":"34207173055","language":"English","title":"Fire at Outer Banks Restaurant Was Arson: Investigators","content":"KILL DEVIL HILLS, NC (WVEC) -- Authorities are asking for the public's help after they say a fire was intentionally set at an Outer Banks restaurant.    Early on the morning of May 28, crews from the Colington Fire Department, Nags Head Fire Department, Dare County Sheriff's Office and the Kill Devil Hills Police Department all responded to a structure fire at the Colington Café in Kill Devil Hills.    The fire was quickly put out due to the fast response of the emergency agencies, and damage was contained to the exterior of the building.    The Sheriff's Office said evidence found at the scene indicates arson.    Owner Kenneth Pearl said the restaurant has been open for nearly 30 years, and he can’t believe anyone would do this.    “That’s the hardest part is just trying to figure out why. Who would do something like this?” said Pearl.    Pearl said the suspect poured a line of gasoline along the side of his restaurant, lit it, and ran.    “To have a fire out here, where there’s nothing and find out it was set and find out somebody tried to end it all,” said Pearl.    Kenneth’s wife Carlen Pearl said they didn’t let the fire stop business.    “We were able to open that night, and I wanted to close but he was like, 'no, that person is not going to put us down, we have families to support here.' So, like I said, mentally I was crushed, but I was proud,” said Carlen Pearl.    Carlen and Kenneth Pearl are offering a $2,000 reward leading to an arrest or conviction of the arsonist.    Anyone who may have any information about this fire can call the Dare County Community Crimeline at 252-473-3111.
