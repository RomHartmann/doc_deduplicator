{"sequenceId":"845363775380","id":"34207162916","language":"English","title":"Initial report suggest heavy downburst caused severe wind damage around Ralls Friday night","content":"The National Weather Service has released a preliminary report detailing some of the events from a Friday night storm that caused lots of wind and hail damage in and around Ralls.   The West Texas Mesonet Station one mile southeast of Ralls recorded a 69 mph wind gust and wind speeds of 44 mph at about 5:45 p.m., according to a news release from the NWS. Around the area homes and buildings sustained heavy damages and U.S. Highway 62/82 was littered with debris from the area.   Dozens of utility poles were thrown down and the Excel Energy company worked throughout the night to restore energy to the areas near Ralls and Crosbyton.   This initial evidence suggests that the damage was the result of a downburst that moved north throughout Ralls along with a supercell thunderstorm, according to NWS. That storm continued to move east and southeast, which produced large hail and high winds that also swept through Crosbyton and Spur.   This information is preliminary and subject to change and a final review of the night's events will be published in the NWS Storm Data database.","contentWithMarkup":"The National Weather Service has released a preliminary report detailing some of the events from a Friday night storm that caused lots of wind and hail damage in and around Ralls.
