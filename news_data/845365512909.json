It’s officially one year late — but the end is near, they hope.

Work at the Woolbright interchange, which started in January 2016, is expected to be done in August.    “All estimations for completion are weather permitting,” Pacini said.

Work at Hypoluxo and Woolbright is part of a $32.5 million project that will also improve the interchanges at 10th Avenue North and Donald Ross Road in Palm Beach County and from Hillsboro Boulevard to Southwest 10th Street in Broward County. All are expected to finish by this summer.    Despite the delay, the construction hasn’t been too much of a headache for drivers because it is done mostly after hours.    Work at Woolbright Road includes:   widening Woolbright from SW 18th Street to SW Second Street, including roadway approaches and bridges over I-95 and the railroad tracks;  providing dual eastbound left-turn lanes onto northbound I-95;  widening the I-95 northbound entrance ramp to receive the newly constructed dual eastbound left turn lanes;  reconstructing the southbound exit ramp to provide free-flow right turn onto westbound Woolbright Road.   Work at Hypoluxo includes:   re-configuring the existing Hypoluxo roadway approaches and bridges over I-95 and the CSX railroad tracks;  constructing dual eastbound left turn lanes onto I-95;  widening the existing southbound exit ramp to lengthen the turn lanes.","contentWithMarkup":"BOYNTON BEACH —  State officials have again pushed back the deadline for completion of improvement work at the Interstate 95 interchanges at Woolbright and Hypoluxo roads.
