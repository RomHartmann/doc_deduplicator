Right now, in the current, highly imbalanced, class dynamics in tf2. I think prolander is exact or very close to the best competitive format which has all classes be viable and allows for dynamic class selections, but I think in the future this format could evolve to be even better.  Since to me, and a lot of people, this is what tf2 is at its core. DM is great, but I didn't put 5000 hours into Quake because I love DM so much, I love tf2 for it's classes and how they play off of each other.  Do I think this is Prolanders final form? I hope not. I'd love to cut the team size down to 6, but the only way this can happen is if the classes in tf2 start to get into closer power levels. Where it's not 98% of the time Scout is the better pick than pyro (2%), but if it was closer to 55-45, or 60-40 or even 50-50.   To me, TF2 is most interesting when the lines of what's correct are blurred. And right now we can make that happen with the seven classes, but I think once tf2 see's more balances in terms of classes overall. I think that'll make the format even better and games more interesting and dynamic.     from overview for sigafoo /r/tf2/comments/8n189l/rglgg_season_4_prolander_registration_is_now_open/e00g4og/  via IFTTT","contentWithMarkup":"<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>So, I actually agree and disagree with this idea.</p> <p>Right now, in the current, highly imbalanced, class dynamics in tf2.
