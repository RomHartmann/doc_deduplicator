{"sequenceId":"845366450244","id":"34207242493","language":"English","title":"Letter to editor: Uphold rights of free speech and assembly","content":"Thank you for printing Lata Nott’s editorial, “Planning pipeline protest? Proposed laws could mean jail time.” She rightly points out that such laws (one is currently making its way through the PA state legislature) are an assault on our rights of freedom of speech and assembly. Without these 1st Amendment rights, our country might still be blighted by segregation, American boys might still be dying in Vietnam, and black men might be routinely assaulted with comment. This particular law is an attempt by big business pipeline interests to silence peaceful protest in our communities.    As a 71-year-old Mennonite grandmother, a pacifist, I stand concerned for the safety and environment of my West Whiteland Township neighborhood, should Sunoco’s ME 1& 2 pipelines resume operation and construction. They carry dangerous NGL’s through such high consequence areas as the Exton library and mall, many housing developments, schools, and eldercare homes. This project has been plagued with accidents, trespass, well fouling, repeated fines for safety violations, and sinkholes.    We have finally won a halt of construction in West Whiteland from PUC Judge Barnes. Sunoco is fighting that ruling by appealing to fellow oil and gas businesses to pressure the PUC to allow them to restart. Judge Barnes has even said there are legal questions about the qualifications of this project as a “public utility.” Given that the project will carry toxic and explosive chemicals to Marcus Hook, then ship them to Scotland to manufacture plastic bags, this is not “critical infrastructure” to anyone but Sunoco!    Gov. Wolf remains unresponsive to our plight. He has literally locked his door and placed a police guard against a citizen delegation accompanied by a state senator. WHAT RECOURSE REMAINS TO US? Without our constitutional rights, we remain at the “mercy” of big business and the pipeline lobby. They have deep pockets and WE HAVE ONLY OUR VOICES and the rightness of our cause.      We are parents, grandparents, care-givers, school principals and superintendents trying to protect those dear to us. This is clearly a David vs Goliath battle and now our state legislature considers destroying even our “slingshot” of protest!    Our peaceful protests intend to educate the public about the danger of ME 1 & 2 coming through our high consequence neighborhoods. WE MUST UPHOLD THE SACRED RIGHTS OF FREE SPEECH AND ASSEMBLY! So we plan another rally on Saturday, June 9, at 3 p.m. on the Chester County Courthouse steps in West Chester. OUR PEACEFUL BUT INSISTENT VOICES MUST BE HEARD AND HEEDED. Please join us.
