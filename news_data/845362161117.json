David Frum Twitter avatar    The liberals went crazy after The New York Times published a 29-page confidential memo Trump’s lawyers sent to Mueller in January.    Trump’s lawyers argued the President cannot be subpoenaed  and that even actions that impede the investigation are within his constitutional authority and therefore cannot be obstruction of justice.    On Saturday, David Frum used domestic violence as a way to argue against Trump’s lawyers’ definition of obstruction of justice.    “Suppose President Trump punched First Lady in the White House…” said David Frum.    Classy.    Frum tweeted:  Suppose President Trump punched the First Lady in the White House (federal property = federal jurisdiction), then ordered the Secret Service to conceal the assault. POTUS has Article II authority over Secret Service. Is that obstruction? Under Sekulow/Dowd, apparently NO     Suppose President Trump punched the First Lady in the White House (federal property = federal jurisdiction), then ordered the Secret Service to conceal the assault.

There are many different ways he could have argued his point without fantasizing about President Trump punching the First Lady.
