{"sequenceId":"845363574219","id":"34207156449","language":"English","title":"Work not complete, but county deserves credit","content":"You can’t declare a job well done before it’s completed.      But you can acknowledge a task is on the right course prior to completion, and that is what is happening with Kankakee County government.      The county has been in a deep financial hole for some time.         The situation was at its worst just two years ago when its general fund featured a whopping $4.9 million deficit.      The blame game that usually accompanies such a problem was at its height at that point. But the problem was not a product of a root cause or a lone culprit. A variety of circumstances created the mess.      It’s now a variety of actions that have caused a turnaround.      They include, but are not limited to, controlling overtime among county employees, reaching union agreement with little or no raises and the expected $5.5 million sale of the county’s stake in a Will County juvenile jail.      The moves scaled the general fund deficit to $3.55 million by the end of 2017, and the deficit is projected to be down to about $946,000 by the end of this year.      As county leaders will readily admit, the problem is not solved and work remains. We say keep up the good work.","contentWithMarkup":"You can’t declare a job well done before it’s completed.
