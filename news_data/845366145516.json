{"sequenceId":"845366145516","id":"34207233748","language":"English","title":"Barbara A. MacInnes","content":", at the University of Maryland Shore Medical Center at Easton.    Barbara was born on Dec. 31, 1937, in Phoenix, Ariz. She was the daughter of the late John Bryant Neville Wheatley and Hortense Amy Lindheim Wheatley.    When she was a year and a half, the family spent six months touring the country seeking another place to live. They ended up in Manhattan, her mother’s hometown. Barbara grew up in nearby Yonkers, N.Y., graduating from Roosevelt High School. She completed her freshman year at Roanoke College in Salem, Va., and married her high school sweetheart, Angus MacInnes, a year later. They moved to North Salem, N.Y., in Northern Westchester County, where they raised four children. The oldest, Karen, a child with special needs, died at 18. Barbara’s granddaughter, Olivia, just finished her junior year at Southern Connecticut State University, and her grandson, Jamie, attended New Fairfield High School.    Barbara became an advocate for children with special needs at the time the Education for All Handicapped Children Act became law. She completed a BS in community services at Empire State, the independent study college of the State University of New York, and received a Master of Public Health from Columbia University’s Mailman School of Public Health in 1982. Her career path included serving as program administrator at the Mental Retardation Institute, Westchester County Medical Center, deputy executive director of the AIDS-related Community Service, serving the seven counties north of New York City, and implementing several Federal Demonstration Grants.    Following retirement to Bath, N.C., in 1996, Barbara formed her own consulting service, writing grants for area Hill Burton hospitals. In 2001, after the birth of their second grandchild, she and her husband moved again, this time to the Eastern Shore. They were drawn by the boat-friendly waterways, the active art community and the model boat guild at the Maritime Museum.    After her husband died in 2013, Barbara continued her interest in painting, participating in Easton’s annual banner program. She also continued going to the St. Michaels YMCA, where she met Chip Britt in 2015, exercising in the Nustep machines. Over time, they found they had much in common and enjoyed each other’s company. They married Jan. 20, 2018. Barbara and Chip moved to Londonderry, Feb. 16.    Barbara is survived by her daughters, Laurel MacInnes and her husband Bill Ardito of Danbury, Conn., Holly (MacInnes) Micca and her husband Peter Micca; grandchildren, Olivia Micca and Jamie Micca of New Fairfield, Conn.; and her husband, Chip Britt of Easton, Md.    In lieu of flowers, the family recommends donations in Barbara’s memory be made to Talbot Special Riders, P.O. Box 391, Easton, MD 21601, or Friends of Karen, 118 Titicus Road, North Salem, NY 10560.
