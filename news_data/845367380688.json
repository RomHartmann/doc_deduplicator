Attendees wore blue to show solidarity with the water.  Among those who attended the event was Georgia's 1st Congressional District Democratic Candidate, Lisa Ring.  \"We have a very active environmental group here in the first district of Georgia and it's really important to involve all the residents in the district in keeping our environment clean and keeping our oceans clean,\" said Ring.
