Janet Bagwell is one of the grandmother of one of the 18-year-old boys. She spoke with 11Alive Saturday saying the families are in a lot of pain, hoping to find them.    Cameron's parents released a handwritten statement about their son and the rescue efforts.         \"The parents of Cameron Smith want to say thank you for the outpour of support from everyone,\" the letter reads.    Cameron's parents said he did not know the other teen, who they name in the letter as Bryant, who went underwater.    \"He was told someone is drowning and without hesitation, he instructed his friend to call 911 and stay safely on solid ground as he jumped in to try to save Bryant. Cameron is truly a hero.\"    \"He's a very loving person,\" Bagwell said. \"He wanted to save the boy.\"         The sheriff's office posted a video Saturday morning of the dam near the site where crews will have to search for the 18-year-old boys.
