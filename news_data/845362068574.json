{"sequenceId":"845362068574","id":"34207106644","language":"English","title":"New walking trail unveiled in Drexel Hill","content":"UPPER DARBY >> It has been 30 years in the making, but the Darby Creek Trail in Drexel Hill was officially opened on Saturday morning.    County and Upper Darby officials cut the ribbon on a one-mile stretch of trail that extends from the Kent Dog Park to the Lower Swedish Cabin along the creek on the border of Clifton Heights.    “This project finally makes Darby Creek something to be enjoyed by area residents instead of just cursed by rush-hour traffic,” said County Council Chairman John McBlain, noting how that area serves as a cut-through for nearby Baltimore Pike traffic.    Upper Darby Mayor Tom Micozzie was on township council in the late ‘80’s when this project started to develop.      “What we have here is a long time of getting together,” said Micozzie.    The project was a culmination of planning, obtaining the necessary parcels of land, working with County Council and securing the funding for it. It was about 10 years ago that then-County Council Chairwoman Linda Cartisano pushed for a dog park for the area to clean up what Micozzie called a spot for “unruly things” to happen. Now the trail is a spruced-up spot for a leisurely walk, run, bike ride and even a little fishing in the creek.    The opening of the trail completes phase one of a proposed trail that planners eventually hope will extend from Little Flower Manor in Darby Borough up to Havertown and beyond.    “Within a short five years we’ll be able to walk from here all the way to Havertown, that’s a great addition,” said Micozzie.    The Darby Creek Trail is now one of more than 100 miles of walking trails throughout the county.    “Open space is a priority to council, and is a premium in this area, and we know that green space brings social, environmental, economic and health benefits to our residents and enhances our quality of life,” said McBlain. “Council continues to take a proactive approach in creating open space opportunities in the county.”    “We’re very excited about the completion of this phase one and hope residents enjoy this beautiful trail.”    Phase one of the Darby Creek Trail was a $1 million investment with two-thirds of the money coming from state grants and the rest from County Council.","contentWithMarkup":"UPPER DARBY >> It has been 30 years in the making, but the Darby Creek Trail in Drexel Hill was officially opened on Saturday morning.
