Friday was to be Bennett’s first day in the position.    Tucker also said the superintendent’s position would again be posted and a public hearing would be scheduled, but she did not yet know the date for the hearing.The required hearing to hire Bennett occurred May 7 with no members of the public speaking at the session. Board members, during a public meeting May 14, voted 7-0 to employ Bennett, from Huntington County, to fill the position.           Unofficial reports of the development were circulating early in the week when the board scheduled an executive session for Wednesday evening. A public session also was scheduled to follow the executive meeting, but it was canceled shortly before it was to begin.    Tucker said more details surrounding the development are expected to be made available in a statement that will be prepared by Gerald Jackson, the corporation’s interim superintendent.           Jackson’s original contract stipulated that he would serve in the interim post until July 18. He also told the board he would stay until a new superintendent had been named and that he would work with that individual during a transition period. Jackson’s final day in the post was to have been Thursday.    Jackson lives in Orange County and is a former Paoli teacher and a retired West Washington Community Schools superintendent. He was named Paoli’s interim superintendent after Casey Brewster resigned from the post amid a divided school board’s criticisms Brewster failed to effectively manage the school corporation’s financial matters and progress in academic affairs.","contentWithMarkup":"PAOLI — Although Paoli school board President Lila Tucker said she was limited on the information she could share because the matter involved personnel, she acknowledged Jon Bennett did not begin duties as the new superintendent of the Paoli Community Schools system.
