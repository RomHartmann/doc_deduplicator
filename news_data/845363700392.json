The new program is now implemented at 116  depots across the province . People can bring stand-up pouches, potato chip bags, zip lock bag and mesh bags use for produce to selected depots.    Allen Langdon, managing director of Recycle B.C. said the project will help the organization determine how best to recycle the materials, which are among the fastest growing packaging on the market.    Due to the combined materials involved in the manufacturing of the various bags, it can be challenging to break down.    “Each day, we move closer toward our ultimate goal of collecting all types of packaging,” Langdon said.    The program expansion is being rolled out in three phases, with the first round of depots beginning collection in June, followed by additional depots voluntarily beginning collection in September. By 2019, all Recycle BC depots in the province are expected to collect this type of packaging.   Examples of materials that are accepted as part of Other Flexible Plastic Packaging:   Stand-up and Zipper Lock Pouches   Zipper lock pouches for frozen foods like prawns, berries and prepared food  Zipper lock bags for fresh foods like grapes, berries and deli meat  Stand-up pouches for baby food and hand soap refills  Stand-up and zipper lock pouches for items like dried fruits, granola, sugar, oatmeal, quinoa, dish detergent pods and grated cheese   Crinkly Wrappers and Bags   Bags for potato chips, candy, dried pasta, coffee and cereal  Cellophane for flowers and gift baskets  Wrappers for cheese slices, snack bars and instant noodles  Flexible Packaging with Plastic Seal  Packaging for fresh pasta, pre-packaged deli meats and pre-packaged cheese   Woven and Net Plastic Bags   Net bags for avocados, onions, oranges, lemons and limes  Woven plastic bags for rice   Non-food Protective Packaging   Padded protective plastic like plastic shipping envelopes, plastic air packets and bubble wrap  Examples of materials that will not be part of the expanded program:  Plastic Squeeze Tubes  Plastic-lined Paper  Paper-lined Plastic  Plastic Strapping  6-pack Rings  Biodegradable or Oxo Plastic  PVC/Vinyl   @ashwadhwani  ashley.wadhwani@bpdigital.ca  Like us on","contentWithMarkup":"Just in time for the summer barbecue season, Recycle B.C. has launched a new collection process for potato chip bags and additional flexible plastic packaging that can often be the hardest materials to recycle and ending up in landfills.
