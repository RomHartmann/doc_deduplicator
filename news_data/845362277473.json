Let them understand, they were in the presence of greatness. Of hard work. Dedication. Devotion. Honor. Integrity. Boldness. Respect. Dignity. Loyalty. Commitment. Let them understand, you took 1000x more of their shit than they ever could have taken of yours, because you always saw the end game. Maybe it got lost in the darkest moments of trying to crawl out of that cave but somehow you just always knew. End game bitches. Read 'em and weep. The day is coming. Do it for that \"Ah-Ha\" moment somebody kept telling me. Let them understand your dedication and devotion and honor and respect and loyalty to a dream and a person and a concept that only the two of us could ever understand sometimes Lucy. It's not arrogance. Not in the least. Anybody that thinks so is foolish. When it's the truth? And everybody knows it? It's confidence.. Pure and simple. Led on by the grace of the power of the Almighty himself. Psalm 27 The Lord is my light and my salvation— whom shall I fear? The Lord is the stronghold of my life— of whom shall I be afraid? So let them know this: They will never ever spend another second of their life with the likes of someone like you. Ever. Done. Peace. I love you Dollbaby.","contentWithMarkup":"worth repeating.<br />\n<br />\nI figure<br />\nit like this.<br />\n<br />\nWhen you leave?<br />\nLet them understand,<br />\nthey were in the presence of greatness.<br />\n<br />\nOf hard work.<br />\nDedication.<br />\nDevotion.<br />\nHonor.<br />\nIntegrity.<br />\nBoldness.<br />\nRespect.<br />\nDignity.<br />\nLoyalty.<br />\nCommitment.<br />\n<br />\nLet them understand,<br />\nyou took 1000x more of their shit<br />\nthan they ever could have taken of yours,<br />\nbecause you always saw the end game.<br />\nMaybe it got lost in the darkest moments<br />\nof trying to crawl out of that cave<br />\nbut somehow you just always knew.<br />\nEnd game bitches.<br />\nRead 'em and weep.<br />\nThe day is coming.<br />\nDo it for that \"Ah-Ha\"<br />\nmoment somebody kept telling me.<br />\n<br />\nLet them understand<br />\nyour dedication and devotion<br />\nand honor and respect and loyalty<br />\nto a dream and a person and a concept<br />\nthat only the two of us could ever understand sometimes Lucy.<br />\n<br />\nIt's not arrogance.<br />\nNot in the least.<br />\nAnybody that thinks so is foolish.<br />\nWhen it's the truth?<br />\nAnd everybody knows it?<br />\nIt's confidence..<br />\nPure and simple.<br />\nLed on by the grace of the power of the Almighty himself.<br />\n<br />\n<h3>\nPsalm 27</h3>\n<br />\nThe Lord is my light and my salvation—<br />\nwhom shall I fear?<br />\nThe Lord is the stronghold of my life—<br />\nof whom shall I be afraid?<br />\n<br />\nSo let them know this:<br />\nThey will never ever<br />\nspend another second of their life<br />\nwith the likes of someone like you.<br />\n<br />\nEver.<br />\n<br />\nDone.<br />\n<br />\nPeace.<br />\n<br />\nI love you Dollbaby.","tags":[],"publishedDate":"2018-06-02T18:04:14Z","harvestDate":"2018-06-02T21:24:53Z","estimatedPublishedDate":"2018-06-02T18:04:14Z","url":"http://ct.moreover.com/?a=34207113776&p=1u0&v=1&x=hg5WkpXPibL7SlEyBXM-wA","originalUrl":"http://armyoftheozoneskip.blogspot.com/2018/06/its.html","commentsUrl":"http://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=8180721342884479968&postID=7189460912244243454","outboundUrls":[],"wordCount":"227","dataFormat":"text","duplicateGroupId":"34207113776","media":{"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[],"logo":[]},"publishingPlatform":{},"adultLanguage":"false","topics":[{"name":"Military news","group":"Society"}],"companies":[],"author":{"name":"Andrew Hollifield","publishingPlatform":{}},"licenses":[],"source":{"name":"Army of the Ozone Skip","homeUrl":"http://armyoftheozoneskip.blogspot.com/","location":{},"feed":{"id":"369740291","name":"Army of the Ozone Skip","mediaType":"Blog","publishingPlatform":"Blogger","generator":"Blogger http://www.blogger.com","description":"Random ramblings from an amateur rock-n-roll historian and critic,self-professed bourbon aficionado, blackberry growin', jam makin', sometime tie-die shirt makin', ex hippie wannabe, turned punk rock lovein', blues festival going, middle aged pudgy bald w","tags":[],"language":"English","dataFormat":"text","rank":{"autoRank":"10","autoRankOrder":"194399","inboundLinkCount":"0"},"inWhiteList":"true","autoTopics":[]}},"es_id":86990466}
