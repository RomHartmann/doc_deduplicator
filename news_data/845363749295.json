The standing water around our homes attract the mosquitoes.  Experts said the rain events have to happen in order for the mosquito population to breed.   To keep them from your home, you should try to clear the wet spots after they happen.  \"The biggest thing is to eliminate the availability of places to collect water,\" said John Cooksey, the Che if operations officer at McCall Service. \"It can be a toy in the yard that get left out there, pet food, bowls, bird baths, all these areas that collect a lot of water can become a mosquito population problem.\"  They also said most mosquitos are active in the morning and evening hours.   It's best to cover yourself with mosquito repellent and long clothing.","contentWithMarkup":"With the heavy rain showers we've seen for the past few weeks, experts said we can expect to see an increase in mosquito populations.
