A question for all the fitness people out there (runners, cyclists, etc.)  Currently I am using Hammer products in my water bottles (Heed and Perpetuum)  However, these are difficult to find.  Is there any, easily available in Ontario, product you use.  I definitely need electrolytes, and I need something with some easily digestible calories to keep me going.  I can more easily shop at Shopper's Drug Mart, Popeyes, GNC, Superstore and even Walmart than some cycle shops which seem out of the way and often closed when I have time to go.  Would really love some recommendations.  If you know some cyclists, please forward them my question because I want as much advice as I can get.  Thank you.","contentWithMarkup":"<img class=\" size-full wp-image-5962 aligncenter\" src=\"https://todaysperfectmoment.files.wordpress.com/2018/06/june-2-ride.png\" alt=\"June 2 ride\" width=\"570\" height=\"191\" />\n\nToday's ride was a little shorter than average, but made much more difficult by a strong headwind and some especially long hills.  The good news is that I felt strong climbing some of the hills and loved hitting 60kph on some of the downhill sections.  Putting in more time on the bike makes things better each week.\n\nA question for all the fitness people out there (runners, cyclists, etc.)  Currently I am using Hammer products in my water bottles (Heed and Perpetuum)  However, these are difficult to find.  Is there any, easily available in Ontario, product you use.  I definitely need electrolytes, and I need something with some easily digestible calories to keep me going.\n\nI can more easily shop at Shopper's Drug Mart, Popeyes, GNC, Superstore and even Walmart than some cycle shops which seem out of the way and often closed when I have time to go.\n\n<em><strong>Would really love some recommendations.  If you know some cyclists, please forward them my question because I want as much advice as I can get.  Thank you.</strong></em>","tags":["Aspirations, Reflections, Perfection","bicycles","cycling","cycling gear","equipment","fitness","health","Newmarket Eagles","nutrition","questions","recommendations","sports","advice","energy","riding","supplements"],"publishedDate":"2018-06-02T21:52:14Z","harvestDate":"2018-06-02T21:52:26Z","estimatedPublishedDate":"2018-06-02T21:52:14Z","url":"http://ct.moreover.com/?a=34207226550&p=1u0&v=1&x=0SK9yk1XsWzuLyB0q-qOuQ","originalUrl":"https://todaysperfectmoment.wordpress.com/2018/06/02/todays-ride-and-a-question/","outboundUrls":[],"wordCount":"176","dataFormat":"text","duplicateGroupId":"34207226550","media":{"audio":[],"images":[{"url":"https://todaysperfectmoment.files.wordpress.com/2018/06/june-2-ride.png"}],"video":[],"logo":[]},"publishingPlatform":{"itemId":"5963"},"adultLanguage":"false","topics":[],"companies":[],"author":{"name":"Anthony","publishingPlatform":{"userId":"39912403"}},"licenses":[],"source":{"name":"Today's Perfect Moment","homeUrl":"https://todaysperfectmoment.wordpress.com","location":{},"feed":{"id":"451444772","name":"Today's Perfect Moment","mediaType":"Blog","publishingPlatform":"WordPress","idFromPublisher":"68269854","generator":"http://wordpress.com/","description":"(formerly Today's Perfect Moment)","tags":[],"language":"English","dataFormat":"text","rank":{"autoRank":"7","autoRankOrder":"121620","inboundLinkCount":"1"},"inWhiteList":"true","autoTopics":[]}},"es_id":86993921}
