The Central Association of Private Security Industry (CAPSI) has approached Prime Minister Narendra Modi alleging conspiracy in handing over national cash management to foreign-based or foreign-controlled companies which will pose security threat to country, besides leaving hundreds of employees jobless. In his letter to the Prime Minister, CAPSI Chairman Kunwar Vikram said: “This decision of RBI will facilitate only two or three foreign based companies engaged in this business to qualify to manage and deliver of the nation to the banks and public through ATMs. We have reasons to believe that assigning national cash management to foreign based/ controlled companies are a potential security threat to the country.” “Imagine a situation if these companies decide to discontinue their operation on any day due to their some undisclosed reasons. What will happen to the nation if cash is not made available to the citizen. It will create unthinkable upheaval in the country,” he mentioned in letter to PM. “Second scenario; if due to external financial crises at their stock exchanges, where these companies are listed, gets crashed and they abruptly discontinue their business operations in India. Entire nation will get into huge and unthinkable critical situation. I don’t know if our National Security Advisor (NSA) was consulted on this issue or any risk analysis was carried out through our national security agencies,” Singh wrote to the Prime Minister. CAPSI also pointed out that RBI in its last month’s notification regarding Cash In Transit (CIT) companies involved in replenishment services of ATMs, cash pick up and cash drop revised norms that companies should have a net worth of Rs 100 crore and a fleet size of 300 vehicles to do the business. The organisation mentioned that it will force around 60 Indian firms downing their shutters, which will be a huge set back to the Government’s Make in India plans in the sector and leave thousands of workers jobless.","contentWithMarkup":"The private security agencies are up in arms against the recent Reserve Bank of India (RBI) circular regarding arbitrary changes in norms for cash logistics business.
