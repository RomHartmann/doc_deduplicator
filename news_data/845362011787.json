(Riccardo Montgomery/KRCG 13).    COLUMBIA —    In his yearly address Friday, Columbia City Manager Mike Mathes said given the current financial state of the city, residents should expect less service from the city's government in future years.    \"Our purchasing power does not match demands for service,\" he said.    Citing a decline in sales tax revenue and low property tax rates, Mathes said the city's current strategy of relying on sales taxes is no longer capable of helping the city move forward. He said in two months, he plans to deliver a budget recommendation meant to address the city's financial situation.    Mathes noted one of his three priorities is to come up with a new financial strategy for the city, one that could include increasing property tax rates. Mathes said a set number had not been determined Friday, but that the increase was something to consider.    \"We can't give raises, we can't keep up with the costs of asphalt, concrete, or salt,\" he said. \"As of last year, we reached the tipping point. We're actually bringing in less money than the year before.\"    Mathes pointed to two other priorities including upgrading the city's water system and expanding public safety services.    Mathes lauded the police department's community policing initiative, noting the department has seen a decrease in calls since first implementing the program. Within the last four years, the department has seen a 4,800 drop in 911 calls, he said.    The city manager is under a six month deadline to determine how to expand the community policing program so that each member of the force is involved. He said ultimately, how that decision is funded will be up to the voters.","contentWithMarkup":"Columbia City Manager Mike Mathes delivers his state of the city address Friday June 1, 2018.
