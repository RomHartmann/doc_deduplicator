But officials at the National Hurricane Center caution against overreliance on the details of all this new information, fearing it could bring false comfort.    The famous cone of uncertainty – also known to storm-jaded Floridians as the cone of death and cone of terror – has shrunk this season , reflecting continued improvement in predicting the path of the storm. But the cone only indicates the likely path of the storm’s center; there’s still danger to communities outside the cone.    “The impacts could be two or three hundred miles away from the cone,” said Ken Graham, director of the National Hurricane Center, in an interview Friday, the official start of hurricane season. “Away from that hurricane you could still get storm surge, you could still get heavy rain, you could still get tornadoes and winds. We have to keep talking about that because it isn’t about the cone.”    Taimy Alvarez/Sun-Sentinel  Ken Graham, director of the National Hurricane Center  Ken Graham, director of the National Hurricane Center (Taimy Alvarez/Sun-Sentinel)     With airplanes, satellites, computer models and squads of forecasters to make sense of the data, we’ve come a long way from the days when a hurricane could loom suddenly off the coast and devastate a community. Today, anyone can go on the National Hurricane Center’s web site and observe for days as patches of stormy weather organize themselves into tropical storms or hurricanes and drift toward Florida and the Caribbean.    Anyone who has been through a hurricane season has seen the cone move a bit north or south with each new advisory, with every update appearing to place some cities in danger and leave others out of it. But Michael Brennan, branch chief of the hurricane center’s Hurricane Specialist Unit, urged residents to avoid focusing on small fluctuations in the cone, saying the bigger picture was far more important.    “We saw this with Irma last year,” he said. “As the forecast moved around a little bit from the east coast to the west coast of Florida, everyone was still at the same level of risk. They were all under hurricane watches and warnings here in South Florida.”    “So we can’t really tell people what the impacts are going to be at their local community level until it’s really too late to make preparations or evacuate, especially in very populated areas like here in South Florida,” he said. “So folks need to not pay so much attention to the details of changes to the official forecast. Pay more attention to the hazards of watches and warnings and the advice you’re given from your local government officials.”    One new tool that will help residents plan for a storm’s arrival will be maps showing the likely arrival time for tropical-force winds of at least 39 mph.    Taimy Alvarez/Sun-Sentinel  Michael Brennan, branch chief, National Hurricane Center Hurricane Specialist Unit  Michael Brennan, branch chief, National Hurricane Center Hurricane Specialist Unit (Taimy Alvarez/Sun-Sentinel)     “That’s really important because when you have sustained tropical storm force winds start, it marks the end of preparation time,” Brennan said. “That’s the time when you want evacuations to be done, everybody wants to have their house boarded up, things like that.”    Another new tool, which went into effect last season, allows forecasters to provide geographic warnings of storm surge , the wind-driven rise in sea level that can cause enormous loss of life.    “Storm surge is a really important hazard because it has the potential to kill the largest number of people in tropical storms and hurricanes,” Brennan said. “The wind gets lots of attention because that’s what drives the category, but 75 percent of the people in the United States die in water from tropical storms and hurricanes. Part of that’s storm surge, part of that’s freshwater flooding.”    In South Florida, the most vulnerable area to storm surge is coastal Miami-Dade County, largely because of Biscayne Bay and the gradual slope of the terrain, he said. In Broward and Palm Beach counties, storm surge is primarily an issue for immediate coastal areas, he said.    But South Florida also relies on canals to keep dry by draining water out to the ocean. In a hurricane, these canals provide highways for the ocean’s water to reach far inland, flooding inland neighborhoods, said Jamie Rhome, team leader for the hurricane center’s Storm Surge Unit.    He urged residents to check their county emergency management web sites to see if they are in an evacuation zone. He also urged homeowners to consider flood insurance.    “If you don’t have flood insurance, your insurance will not cover flood damage,” he said. “Just because you’re not required to have flood insurance, that doesn’t mean you shouldn’t get it.”    dfleshler@sun-sentinel.com, 954-356-4535","contentWithMarkup":"As hurricane season opens, an array of new tools will improve forecasters’ ability to tell us exactly when and where we can expect the arrival of the storm’s violence.
