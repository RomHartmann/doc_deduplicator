Anjan Chatterjee applied for his daughter’s math paper re-evaluation through CBSE’s online protal in June 2017 by paying the requisite fee and even received an acknowledgement for it. “Months passed by and there was no change in status whenever I checked online. I got feedback after almost a year when the PMO intervened on my behalf,” said Chatterjee.  Though his daughter Onjula, who had scored an impressive 92% in XII, had already moved on with her academic pursuits, Chatterjee was keen on getting a closure in the matter.   The re-evaluation request was placed in June last year and a frustrated Chatterjee wrote to PMO in April this year. “I was constantly checking the web site but there was no update for months which is not expected of a professional board like CBSE. Finally on April 17 I wrote to PMO and apprised them of my grievance. The PMO then forwarded the letter to CBSE and a chain of events followed,” said Chatterjee.    According to Chatterjee, CBSE’s secretary sent the query to Chennai regional office under whose jurisdiction Nagpur schools fall. “Last month I got a reply from CBSE saying there was no change in marks and it was displayed on website. But there was no such intimation on the site and it was only after my follow-up that I got some answers from them,” said Chatterjee.  He believes that CBSE had forgotten to re-evaluate it and has now again written to PMO regarding it. “This is evidently a cover-up to protect the CBSE’s inaction, lethargy and indifferent attitude towards examinees. Ever since application for revaluation, there was no communication of any kind by the CBSE and now when I complain to the PMO, they come up with a doctored reply,” said Chatterjee.  He goes on to add that no revaluation records have been provided by CBSE. “They have not even bothered to state subject in which revaluation was sought, after paying the requisite fee, nor quoted the marks. The future of students are in jeopardy at the hands of such erring officials, who need to be subjected to disciplinary action, severely punished and awarded major penalties under the Central Civil Services (Classification, Control and Appeals) Rules, 1965,” said Chatterjee.  TOI tried getting a reaction from CBSE but our calls to their spokesperson went unanswered.","contentWithMarkup":"Nagpur: A city parent claims that CBSE forgot to re-evaluate his daughter’s Std XII paper in 2017 and it took no less than the Prime Minister’s Office (PMO) to get things moving.
