I currently live in Tübingen but I come from a village near Lüneburg in Lower Saxony (which is at the north of Germany). I study Media Studies and English Studies. In my free time, I love to play my guitar and sing, especially with friends. I also like sport such as swimming or judo. My favourite places to be here in Tübingen are the public swimming pools, especially the one outdoors, because I like swimming, but I also like the botanic garden to play music or hang out with friends.  I'm John Mao from Macau. I study Communication as a major and sociology as a minor. In my free time I like visiting foreign countries, I for example plan to visit either France, Austria or Holland next. I don't have any favourite places yet.","contentWithMarkup":"<p class=\"P2\"><img class=\"alignnone  wp-image-2192\" src=\"https://iestuebingen.files.wordpress.com/2018/06/img_20180521_143650.jpg\" alt=\"IMG_20180521_143650.jpg\" width=\"134\" height=\"179\" /></p>\n<p class=\"P2\">My name is <strong>Niklas</strong> Kamin.
