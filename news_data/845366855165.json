All rights reserved. This material may not be published, broadcast, rewritten, or redistributed.   We spent 27 days with temperatures above average.  June started well above average - yesterday was quite hot with highs in the 90s and heat indices closing in on 100°.  Today, it'll be a little bit cooler with highs in the mid-80s, but still quite humid.   We are starting off with some sunshine this morning, but don't be fooled.  The clouds will fill in by midday and give way to scattered showers this afternoon/evening.  If you have any outdoor activities planned, try to squeeze them in as early as you can, but if you have to be out later on, keep an umbrella handy.   This wet weather will be courtesy of a cold front.  An area of low pressure will ride along the frontal boundary and hover over Hampton Roads through Sunday.  Isolated storms and downpours are possible, so that's why a FLASH FLOOD WATCH will be in effect from 2 PM through early Sunday.   Right now, we are not expecting any strong or severe storms, but you know, we always have to keep en eye on that situation.  If any warnings are issued, we'll let you know!   Scattered showers will continue overnight into Sunday.  Intermittent showers in the forecast as we close out the weekend.  At least Sunday will be cooler with highs in the mid to upper-70s....that's my silver lining around that dreary forecast.   Right now, next week is looking great - mostly dry..seasonable temperatures..and more tolerable levels of humidity.  What more could you want??   So whether you're heading to Patriotic Festival in Virginia Beach, Blackbeard Pirate Festival in Hampton, the Greek Festival in Newport News, or the Tides game in Norfolk, enjoy your time and stay dry!","contentWithMarkup":"07:11 AM EDT   Updated: Jun 02, 2018 07:11 AM EDT   Copyright 2018 Nexstar Broadcasting, Inc.
