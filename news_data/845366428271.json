{"sequenceId":"845366428271","id":"34207242007","language":"English","title":"","content":"The heatwaves continued, and with it came another wave of Spotted Flycatchers. A total of 62 were noted across the island today which is an impressive influx when you compare it to just the one bird logged yesterday! An unringed Greenish Warbler was found singing in the observatory garden early in the morning confirming the presence of at least two different birds on the island in the past couple of days, whilst two Arctic Skuas and a Greenshank gave close fly-pasts on the South End. Late in the afternoon a female Red-backed Shrike appeared in the gorse above Cafn. Unlike the extremely elusive individual seen on 11th May, this bird was more obliging and gave distant but prolonged views against the heat haze as it fed on insects. Other birds logged today included four Fulmars, 187 Manx Shearwaters, 26 Gannets, a Grey Heron, a Buzzard, a Lapwing, three Dunlins, two Bar-tailed Godwits, a Whimbrel, a Curlew, eight Turnstones, two Common Terns, two Collared Doves, three Swifts, a Robin, five Stonechats, 15 Wheatears, four Sedge Warblers, a Whitethroat, a Garden Warbler, two Blackcaps, nine Chiffchaffs, a Willow Warbler, three Chaffinches, a Goldfinch, 22 Linnets and three Lesser Redpolls. The second Wall Brown butterfly of the year was on the mountain whilst Silver Y's continue to be flushed from almost every patch of vegetation on the island. Today's Red-backed Shrike did the right thing and stuck around for everyone to enjoy, unlike the super-elusive bird earlier in the month which only showed extremely briefly for a couple of seconds at a time. Oystercatcher chicks are starting to hatch across the island's coastline. So far 48 nests have been located, with a few sections of the West Coast still to be covered. Gold Spot (top) and Buff-tip went down well with the 19 visitors who came to help us check the moth trap this morning. 'Crowd-pleasers' like these provide a fantastic way of engaging people with the spectacular world of moths. Ragged Robin is adding a splash of pink to the Wetlands at the moment.","contentWithMarkup":"The heatwaves continued, and with it came another wave of Spotted Flycatchers.
