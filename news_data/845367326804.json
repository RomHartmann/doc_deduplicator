The red geraniums had been a hanging basket that went on clearance.  I just clipped the plastic hanging part of it off.  The oval planter was on clearance a couple weeks ago.  I was able to add a lot of color for a small amount of money. Behind them sits the basil, I'm only growing one pot this year but it is a big one.  It needs to be trimmed and harvested.  I tend to let my basil and mints grow way to much before using them because they are pretty when full like that. I think this is the largest basil plant I've ever grown in a pot! I was asked about hummingbirds, the answer is yes!  Hummingbirds are attracted to the color red.  If you notice, most hummingbird feeders are red in color (although you should not dye their water red).  They are attracted to other flowers and scents but they especially like red flowers. I usually grow bee balm because hummingbirds like it but this year I decided I'd grow mostly herbs I cook with.  The two exceptions are in the photos below... The pineapple sage always surprises me at how fast it grows. I grow pineapple sage each year because of its' beauty, the flowers attract hummingbirds (although I live far enough north that sometimes they bloom after the hummingbirds have left), and the leaves smell gorgeous. The leaves can be used in drinks and on salads and one can use them in flower arrangements. I never have and I should try actually using the leaves this year. Just one teeny tiny start grows into this huge plant.  It will grow much larger than this and I have had to replant it twice already, this is where it will remain. I'm growing Sweet Annie in a large flowerpot for the first time this year (the pot I usually use for bee balm).  It is one of my favorite scents.  I'm hoping to make a wreath out of it. Two mints, a tiny basil, and a geranium waiting to bloom again.  I had an extra red flower so I popped it in with the herbs. I always grow rosemary, lemon thyme, and English thyme. I'll add to my deck garden as the budget permits.  Quite a few places have their flowers on sale now.  While not quite as nice as being able to grow veggies in the raised bed garden, it is always good to do something rather than nothing.  :)","contentWithMarkup":"<div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-CgrsghHERZY/WxL0xmJ_6YI/AAAAAAAAW-M/IVFBB6SLhRkHHlkjyeaIqT3KuVo4UMK6gCLcBGAs/s1600/P1230684.JPG\" imageanchor=\"1\" style=\"margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;\"><img border=\"0\" data-original-height=\"1200\" data-original-width=\"1600\" height=\"480\" src=\"https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-CgrsghHERZY/WxL0xmJ_6YI/AAAAAAAAW-M/IVFBB6SLhRkHHlkjyeaIqT3KuVo4UMK6gCLcBGAs/s640/P1230684.JPG\" width=\"640\" /></a></div><br />I'm enjoying my deck garden and I'm adding to it when I find flowers or herbs on sale.  The yellow dahlia was a sale item this morning, I stopped by the garden shop on my way home from Aldi's and they were on sale for $4.00.  Finally I had a yellow flower and a beautiful dahlia at that.<br /><br />The red geraniums had been a hanging basket that went on clearance.  I just clipped the plastic hanging part of it off.  The oval planter was on clearance a couple weeks ago.  I was able to add a lot of color for a small amount of money.<br /><br />Behind them sits the basil, I'm only growing one pot this year but it is a big one.  It needs to be trimmed and harvested.  I tend to let my basil and mints grow way to much before using them because they are pretty when full like that.<br /><br /><div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-U1DYrEPKnJM/WxL0T0ZMz9I/AAAAAAAAW90/IXVxwT4QvpkziLSR1J_XpvkIm2wFTY3jQCLcBGAs/s1600/P1230677.JPG\" imageanchor=\"1\" style=\"margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;\"><img border=\"0\" data-original-height=\"1200\" data-original-width=\"1600\" height=\"480\" src=\"https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-U1DYrEPKnJM/WxL0T0ZMz9I/AAAAAAAAW90/IXVxwT4QvpkziLSR1J_XpvkIm2wFTY3jQCLcBGAs/s640/P1230677.JPG\" width=\"640\" /></a></div><div style=\"text-align: center;\">I think this is the largest basil plant I've ever grown in a pot!</div><br />I was asked about hummingbirds, the answer is yes!  Hummingbirds are attracted to the color red.  If you notice, most hummingbird feeders are red in color (although you should not dye their water red).  They are attracted to other flowers and scents but they especially like red flowers.<br /><br />I usually grow bee balm because hummingbirds like it but this year I decided I'd grow mostly herbs I cook with.  The two exceptions are in the photos below...<br /><br /><div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-hU0uRBbsF0o/WxL7987ZsBI/AAAAAAAAW-g/gZ0IVDrj7aU35HK7kCwmX_n2ipqQPoqygCLcBGAs/s1600/P1230674.JPG\" imageanchor=\"1\" style=\"margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;\"><img border=\"0\" data-original-height=\"1200\" data-original-width=\"1600\" height=\"480\" src=\"https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-hU0uRBbsF0o/WxL7987ZsBI/AAAAAAAAW-g/gZ0IVDrj7aU35HK7kCwmX_n2ipqQPoqygCLcBGAs/s640/P1230674.JPG\" width=\"640\" /></a></div><div style=\"text-align: center;\">The pineapple sage always surprises me at how fast it grows.</div><div style=\"text-align: center;\"><br /></div>I grow pineapple sage each year because of its' beauty, the flowers attract hummingbirds (although I live far enough north that sometimes they bloom after the hummingbirds have left), and the leaves smell gorgeous.<br /><br />The leaves can be used in drinks and on salads and one can use them in flower arrangements.
