{"sequenceId":"845362177150","id":"34207110426","language":"English","title":"Authentic peace can come only from Jesus","content":"As you ascend the steps to enter St. Stephen Cathedral, cast your gaze upward above the main front doors. You will notice a magnificent mosaic of Christ with arms extended in welcome. Observe the words in bold lettering, “Peace To All Who Enter Here!”  To me this mosaic is Jesus saying: Whatever you are experiencing at this stage in your life — the ecstatic joy of an engaged couple preparing to be married, the deep sadness of a widow following her husband’s casket, the worried parent of a straying young adult, the childlike innocence of a youngster eager to receive Jesus for the first time in Holy Communion, the sorrowing penitent burdened with a regrettable sin that begs for mercy, the seasoned love of a couple celebrating their golden wedding anniversary, the heartbroken spouse who has just been asked for a divorce, the skeptical young adult who questions God’s love and plan, the proud graduate whose hard work has accomplished a milestone, the incredulous sterile couple weighed down by the possibility of a childless marriage — yes, whatever you are experiencing, you are welcome here in this sacred place, and I long to sustain you with my peace.  Is there anything more sought after and valued in our life than peace? Peace of mind. World peace. Peace in our country. Family peace. Peace within myself. Inner peace. Money can’t buy it and prestige can’t acquire it. Faith in the Lord can bestow this invaluable fruit of the Spirit.  Peace is often described as the absence of conflict, distraction or anything that makes us feel uncomfortable or disturbed. A person is at peace when one feels relaxed and comfortable; a nation is at peace when not involved in war. “Daughter, your faith has saved you,” assured Jesus, “Go in peace and be cured of your affliction” (Mark 5:34). Like this anonymous tortured woman, we long to be whole. We yearn for serenity, restfulness, calmness, tranquility, peacefulness in our hearts. This is the kind of peace that the world cannot give.  What if I told you that the biblical idea of peace sometimes means diving into conflict, choosing discomfort, and being disturbed? The biblical notion of peace is much broader than simply the absence of conflict, but the presence of harmony. It’s not cease fire; it’s community. According to Ephesians, Jesus is our peace, and came to reconcile us both to God and to each other (Ephesians 2:14ff). Therefore, at times we are called to stand up and speak out when the rights of another person — regardless of background, ethnicity, gender, religion, status, disability — are infringed upon. In these cases, it is not acceptable to marinate in our comfortableness. We must speak out! There is that inner voice within us that gives us the courage to do what is right in the face of injustice.  Yes, the arms of Jesus are extended to welcome everyone into his embrace. “Peace to all who enter here”! Then, strengthened, healed, and renewed by word and sacrament, we are “sent forth” to be Jesus’ presence in our world. Go, love and serve the Lord, and People of God, the community. Peace be with you!  The Rev. W. Jerry Riney is pastor of the Catholic Cathedral of St. Stephen, 612 Locust St.","contentWithMarkup":"As you ascend the steps to enter St. Stephen Cathedral, cast your gaze upward above the main front doors.
