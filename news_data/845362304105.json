{"sequenceId":"845362304105","id":"34207114459","language":"English","title":"Next Leeds United manager odds: Marcelo Bielsa update, latest on Claudio Ranieri","content":"Leeds United sacked Paul Heckingbottom on Friday afternoon.  Leeds United are once again looking for a new manager having decided to part ways with Paul Heckingbottom on Friday, less than four months after appointing him.  The Whites were in a similar position last summer after seeing Garry Monk leave the club, and replacement Thomas Christiansen started well before fading away, eventually being sacked in February.  Owner Andrea Radrizzani swooped for Barnsley boss Heckingbottom just days later, but with just four wins in 16 games, he failed to convince fans and clearly didn't convince Radrizzani, as he met his end at Elland Road on Friday.  Leeds fans are all too familiar with checking bookmakers' odds for their new manager, , here are some of the main names in the frame for the Elland Road hot seat.  Marcelo Bielsa is the stunning favourite for the job at just 1/6, with the Argentinian clearly leading the race to replace Heckingbottom in what would be a staggering move from the Whites.  Bielsa, 62, may be a controversial and enigmatic figure, but he brings huge experience and tactical nous on both the international and the domestic stage, and has been out of work since leaving Lille in December after just five wins in 19 games.  For anybody looking beyond Bielsa, Radrizzani's fellow Italian Claudio Ranieri is in at 5/1 having left Nantes last month. Radrizzani made comments about wanting a Ranieri-like figure in charge of Leeds earlier this year, and he may now have a clear shot at the former Leicester City boss.  Boyhood Leeds fan Mick McCarthy is at 8/1 having left Ipswich Town, with Carlos Carvalhal, Sam Allardyce and Steve Bruce some of the other names touted - but Bielsa appears to be close to a done deal if bookmakers are to be believed.","contentWithMarkup":"Leeds United sacked Paul Heckingbottom on Friday afternoon.
