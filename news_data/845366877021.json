{"sequenceId":"845366877021","id":"34207252302","language":"English","title":"Biosolids pose risk","content":"Share this page...     Wise County Farmers, are you naive enough to believe that the sewage industry (Fort Worth/Renda) has the public health interests in mind or is it simple greed and a need to get rid of the toxic contamination as cheaply as possible?    No one questions what the sewage industry’s definition of safe is. Everyone assumes it is free from risk like the definition in the average dictionary. It does not mean free from risk.    Here are some red flags from the same agency that made it legal:   Every US industry connected to a sewer can discharge any amount of hazardous and acute hazardous waste into sewage treatment plants as long as they report it. Yeow right! There are over 85,000 chemicals in commerce and growing even today. It ends up in biosolids and effluent and even bags taken to the consumer’s home and used in their garden. See ( epa.gov/tsca-inventory/about-tsca-chemical-substance-inventory ) See also the Targeted National Survey of Sewage Sludge 2009.  US EPA Office Inspector General (OIG) Report No. 14-P-0363 in 09/2014. To sum up, industrial pretreatment is not working and has never worked and nothing has been done about it. It ends up in biosolids and sewage plant effluent. “The priority pollutants list has not been updated since 1981.”   So when you hear anyone from the multi-billion dollar sewage industry or anyone with monetary ties to any part of the sewage industry say the chemicals in biosolids are minimal and inconsequential or that they support composting with biosolids, ask them for any test showing the degree of hazard and concentrations of 80,000 chemicals that are found in biosolids or a composted biosolids like Milorganite from Milwaukee or Fort Worth Class AB EQ, which there is no such thing as Class AB EQ. The EQ standing for exceptional quality, which is pushing consumer fraud.    Nearly all chronic diseases result from the cumulative effects of long-term exposure to low levels of environmental contaminants and pollutants, and our air, soil, food and water, which are essential resources that assure the sustainability of human and other life forms, must be protected and preserved at all cost.
