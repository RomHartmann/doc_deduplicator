The union representing the district's professional staff announced its intentions Tuesday, after more than two years of negotiations.    “All we want to do is be able to teach and do what we love,” President Ann Catrillo of the East Stroudsburg Education Association said in the union's statement. “The last thing we want is to be out of the classroom. We have proposed a contract that is not only fair to teachers, but fair to the community and the students we serve.”    The school board's negotiation committee put two separate offers on the table over the course of three meetings between April 19 and May 2, said Chairwoman Lisa VanWhy. Committee members expected to see a counterproposal during the Tuesday night meeting.    They were greeted with the strike notice instead.    “We provided two richer, different offers, as we've continued to do all along,” VanWhy said. “We have offered quite a substantial amount of money in raises and backed out of some of the healthcare sticking points. Of course we respect our teachers, but our main point is to offer a contract that is affordable and still maintain a high level of education for students.”    The district's professional staff has been working on an expired contract since August 31, 2016, when the term of the most recent contract ended. Several proposals have gone back and forth since that time, including one from a state-hired fact finder last year.    Healthcare and wage costs remain the major sticking points in negotiations, but how those costs are calculated has caused controversy as well. The union contends that its previous proposals meet the limits of what the district can afford over the life of the contract without needing a tax increase.    Negotiators are scheduled to meet before the June 18 school board meeting, with several opportunities to reach a compromise before the strike date. Teachers still hope to avoid the picket lines, said union spokesman Matt Gruenloh, but the notice shows that they mean business.    “The board has not really been taking these negotiations seriously, to the point where we have made information requests that have gone ignored,” he said. “Putting in this notice says, ‘We're willing to negotiate a solution over the summer, but if you're going to be obstinate and not work with us, know that we're going to be on strike in September.’”","contentWithMarkup":"East Stroudsburg Area School District teachers have set Sept. 10 as a strike date.
