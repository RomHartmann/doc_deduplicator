They (perhaps foolishly) said yes and so here's what I sent them. Each received a painted or collaged note card, with a message from me about the picture as well as a personal greeting. Why? It made me feel good. It encouraged me to make something specific, tangible, physical. And I knew they'd enjoy getting a piece of snail mail. Snail mail that wasn't an advertisement. And if someone is reading this right now and would like a little personal note from me, send me an e-mail with your address and I'll put something in the mail to you.
