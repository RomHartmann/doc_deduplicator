The Salvation Army of Shamokin hosted its 5th Annual Duck Drop at Knoebels Amusement Park in Elysburg.    People in the community purchased rubber ducks for $10 then sent them down the log flume waters.    The first 10 winners in three heats get gift cards to local retailers.    Then, the winner of the final race earns a $200 Knoebels vacation package.    “Each year has been getting bigger and we know next year will be bigger yet, so it’s a good fundraiser and we appreciate that people have it,” Henry Linpon, Board President of the Salvation Army of Shamokin, said.    “I thank God for the generosity of the people who care about others and want to make a difference with us,” Major Tammy Hench, Corps Officer for the Salvation Army of Shamokin, said.    460 duck tickets were purchased this year.    That means $4,600 will go towards programs sponsored by the Salvation Army of Shamokin.","contentWithMarkup":"ELYSBURG, NORTHUMBERLAND COUNTY (WOLF) -- Hundreds of rubber duckies raised thousands of dollars for a local chapter of the Salvation Army in Northumberland County.
