It was getting dark and there was nothing to do. I have an idea. Let's play 20 Questions.    For those of us with a bit of age under our belts, the question of “being bigger than a bread box”  may bring back a memory or two. Long before computers, game boys and other electronic devices kids  use today,  many of the games kids played often required nothing more than a bit of creativity and imagination. One of those games was 20 Questions and its popularity peaked in the late 1940's and early 1950's along with a weekly quiz program on the radio, although I admit I do not remember the radio show. (I do remember a version of this game show on the television.)    The game could be played in the living room or while traveling in the car and was quite simple. If my memory serves me correctly, one person was chosen to answer the questions. That person would choose an object, perhaps in the room where everyone was sitting,  but not reveal what it was to the others. Each would take turns asking questions, which,  in its early years could only be answered with a 'yes' or 'no.' To add a bit of a  challenge, 'maybe' soon became an acceptable answer too.    If a 'questioner' guessed the correct answer, that person was declared the winner and became the 'answerer'. If no one guessed correctly after 20 questions, those playing were 'stumped' and the 'answerer' was declared the winner and would continue for another round. (Sounds a bit like one of those college drinking game, don't you think?)    Lying was not allowed and in today's world, that might eliminate a number of people from participating in the game,  those folks needing to find their own games to play for entertainment.    One of the keys to a successful game was the careful selection of questions. The person skilled in asking  the 'right ' questions had a distinct advantage over others  and I suspect many of those folks with that skill moved on to become great problem solvers in the world, maybe like attorneys and lawyers. Just kidding. Many probably became teachers.    Over the years the game took on some changes and new forms, with a better known version played being “Animal, Vegetable, and Mineral.” Even today, classroom teachers may use this game as part of the study of science. For example...”was today's school lunch animal, vegetable or mineral?”    Cell phones, computers and the hundreds of other electronic devices have changed the way we play, and in so doing, may be slowing changing the way we think. Today it is too easy to move off into the corner of a room, isolated from others around you and playing  Candy Crush for hours. I know there are parts of the game that allow you to challenge friends to a game or two, seeing who can get the higher score. But for the most part there may be  little actual verbal interaction with anyone else, except when mom tells you that dinner is ready..... and you have yet to finish your lunch.    For some reason, after doing a bit of research, 20 seems to be the magical number of questions to be asked when seeking information, not just for 20 Questions, but for 'life' question  too. For example...Interested in dating the  new girl who just moved into town? There is a list of twenty questions to ask her in order to get to know her before you ask her out.    Or perhaps you are looking for a new piece of furniture for your home. There is a list of twenty questions to ask the sales person before buying. And the most important question? Is there a lifetime guarantee that this will not fall apart?    My favorite list..... twenty questions to ask you local candidate running for political office. And try to get those answers with just a simple ‘yes’ or 'no'.     The game of 20 Questions may have done more than just keep us busy when the power went out. It made us use our imagination. It gave us to spend time with family or friends even if  we  did realize it. It sometimes made us laugh. But most important....it made us think, as silly as some of those questions may have seemed at times .     So, anyone up for a game of 20 Questions? And I'll tell you right up front, the object I am thinking about is....'bigger than a bread box.'","contentWithMarkup":"<br /><div style=\"margin: 0px;\"><br /></div><br /><div style=\"margin: 0px;\"><span style=\"font-size: 14pt; margin: 0px;\"><span style=\"margin: 0px;\">  </span></span><span style=\"font-size: 14pt; margin: 0px;\">The electric power had been out for hours.
