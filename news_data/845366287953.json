The OPP’s Huronia West detachment announced Friday that Ottawa’s Alex Perlmutter, 21, was arrested in Mount Albert in connection with the break and enter and theft of the Elmvale animals.     JC the lemur, Stanley the tortoise and Agnes the gibbon follow special diets tailored to them and may not survive in the wild, a zoo spokesperson said.   ( Elmvale Jungle Zoo / Facebook )    However, Huygen said there’s no news on the animals’ location, which is worrisome to zoo staff. She said JC the lemur and Agnes the gibbon follow tailored diets ripe with fruits and vegetables — JC favours grapes and bananas, while Agnes can’t have citrus but loves peppers — and if they are loose outside, they are at risk.    “We don’t really have a whole lot of that (food) in our Canadian wildlife, so I would say (survival is) not great,” Huygen said, noting she didn’t know if the animals were free or in captivity.    “They’re used to being fed a certain diet the same time every day by their same handlers, so they’re used to a routine that they definitely haven’t been receiving (after the theft).”       Article Continued Below       The same goes for Stanley. For seven years at the zoo, the 18-inch-long tortoise ate lettuce, hay and tomatoes — tough to find outdoors in Ontario at this time of year.    Huygen said zoo owners and staff are asking people to “keep their eyes and ears open” for out-of-place animals near their homes.    “If you see a gibbon or a black-and-white lemur out in the open, that’s out of the ordinary,” she said, asking that such sightings be reported to police.    The zoo, about 26 kilometres northwest of Barrie, was broken into some time between 9 p.m. Monday and 6 a.m. Tuesday.    Huygen said a segment of chain-link fence by the zoo parking lot was cut in an inconspicuous spot. She said zoo owner Sam Persi realized the animals were missing during a regular early-morning inspection of the grounds on Tuesday. The value of the animals is more than $20,000.      Police were called and zoo manager Michel Persi took to Facebook last week to plead for the animals’ return. Michel, Sam’s daughter, also announced a $10,000 reward for information on the theft.    Huygen said the zoo owners and staff were “just devastated” at the brazen act and were baffled as to why, of the more than 300 animals at Elmvale, the lemur, gibbon and tortoise were stolen. She said Friday’s arrest is giving everyone hope of “getting our babies home.”    The OPP said in a statement the investigation is continuing.         TOP STORIES, DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX.
