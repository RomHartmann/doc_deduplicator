{"sequenceId":"845366068079","id":"34207230764","language":"English","title":"Gal Gadot could become the first female superhero to win Best Hero","content":"The MTV Movie and TV Awards first handed out the award for Best Hero in 2006, and then brought the category back in 2012 and every year since. It was exclusively a boys club for most of that time, but women have won for the last two years in a row, and now there might be a third: Gal Gadot , who currently leads our predictions with 8/13 odds for playing the title role in “ Wonder Woman .” She would be the first female comic-book hero ever to win the award.   But it’s not like there have been a wealth of female superhero movies to reward over the years. “Wonder Woman” broke the glass ceiling when it was released in 2017 to critical acclaim and huge box office totals ($821 million worldwide). Before that female comic book characters were relegated to ensemble movies and didn’t get to headline their own films: Black Widow ( Scarlett Johansson ) in the “Avengers” movies, Harley Quinn ( Margot Robbie ) in “Suicide Squad,” and Wonder Woman herself in “Batman v. Superman: Dawn of Justice.”   There have been a couple of comic-book women to make the cut with nominations in this race: Jessica Alba as Sue Storm in “Fantastic Four” (2006) and Anne Hathaway as Catwoman in “The Dark Knight Rises” (2013). But they’re greatly outnumbered by the men who have contended, including Chris Evans (two nominations as Captain America), Chris Hemsworth (two nominations as Thor), Robert Downey Jr. (two nominations as Iron Man) and Grant Gustin (two nominations as TV’s “The Flash”). And two men have won as caped crusaders: Christian Bale as Batman in “Batman Begins” (2006) and Henry Cavill as Superman in “Man of Steel” (2014).   But women have been on the rise. This award went to men the first five times it was given out, but then Jennifer Lawrence (“The Hunger Games: Mockingjay, Part 2”) won as Katniss Everdeen in 2016, and Taraji P. Henson (“ Hidden Figures “) prevailed as real-life NASA hero Katherine Johnson in 2017.   Now Gadot is the favorite to win in 2018. She’s backed by four Editors who cover awards year-round for Gold Derby, 19 of our Top 24 Users who got the highest scores predicting last year’s MTV Awards, and 19 of our All-Star Top 24 who got the highest scores when you combine the last two years’ predictions.   But she has to watch out for Chadwick Boseman (“ Black Panther “), who would be the first Marvel hero to win and the first man of color. He ranks second in our predictions with 10/3 odds and support from four Top Users and five All-Stars. However, Boseman is also nominated for Best Performance in a Movie, so it’s possible fans voting online will support him there (where he’s the projected front-runner to win ) so they can spread the wealth to Gadot here. Then again, you could say the same about Gadot, who is also nominated for Best Fight and could divide her support as well.   Do you agree with our consensus that “Wonder Woman” will best “Black Panther” in this contest? Or will the King of Wakanda also be the king of the MTV Awards?   Be sure to make your MTV Movie and TV Award predictions so that Hollywood studio executives and top name stars can see how their films and shows are faring in our odds. Don’t be afraid to jump in now since you can keep changing your predictions until winners are announced on June 18. And join in the fierce debate over the 2018 MTV Awards taking place right now with Hollywood insiders in our film forums .
