{"sequenceId":"845362127780","id":"34207108887","language":"English","title":"Spicy twists to mala","content":"It is clear that Singaporeans like it hot, tongue-numbingly hot.    It started with the craze for mala hotpot, then with the trend of mala xiang guo (a stir-fried version of mala hotpot) outlets, which have become a permanent fixture in foodcourts and hawker centres.    And as the love of \"ma\" (tongue-numbing) and \"la\" (spicy) flavours takes hold in Singapore, enter the third wave of non-Sichuan mala food.    Think mala flavours for dishes from chicken rice to pizza.    Do not worry about ingredients swimming in a fiery pit of oil filled with dried chillies and Sichuan peppercorns, as these interesting interpretations are generally less spicy than the conventional mala options.    As Mr Rodney Tang - managing director of RTG Holdings, which runs local bubble tea chain LiHO, Taiwan pizza chain Tino's Pizza Cafe and Gong Yuan Mala Tang, a casual eatery that offers a soup version of mala xiang guo - puts it: \"There are plenty of mala xiang guo and mala hotpot outlets everywhere, showing that Singaporeans are receptive to the flavour.\"    Banking on the mala craze, Mr Tang has opened his second Gong Yuan Mala Tang outlet at Westgate mall in Jurong East and has another slated for next month in Orchard Road. The brand first opened at Heartland Mall in Kovan last year.    At hip foodcourt Makanista at Tampines Mall, the chicken rice stall offers a Mala Chicken Rice, where a housemade mala sauce is added to the poached or roasted chicken.    Makanista's marketing manager Khoo Wei Xin, 27, says: \"Since Makanista serves local delights with an interesting twist, we have to serve the quintessential Singaporean favourite - chicken rice, inspired by the flavours of Sichuan.    \"It's been interesting to see the rise of the mala trend in Singapore, perhaps for the past two years or so. We wanted to offer something that was a spin-off of mala xiang guo, yet familiar to the local palate.\"    Other options include mala Irish duck at modern Chinese restaurant Lokkee at Plaza Singapura; and mala crab from Qi - House of Sichuan, a one-Michelin-starred eatery from Hong Kong at Marina Bay Link Mall.    Qi - House of Sichuan head chef Wong Chun Fai's spin on shui zhu yu - braised garoupa fish fillet in chilli oil soup ($40 or $50) - features less oil than the usual options, so diners can drink the fiery soup.    And while restaurant owners believe that the mala madness is here to stay, Si Chuan Dou Hua's executive Sichuan chef Zeng Feng, 52, hopes Singaporeans will discover other flavours of Sichuan cuisine.    He says: \"In Singapore and many countries, people continue to equate Sichuan food solely with the 'ma la' flavour perhaps because it is most memorable.    Other flavours deserve a worthy mention, such as garlic and chilli, and Sichuan minced pepper.    \"We have noticed more Singaporean diners ordering authentic yet non-spicy Sichuan dishes such as stir-fried French beans with minced meat or crispy rice bubble with sliced pork, demonstrating their knowledge of the depth of Sichuan cuisine.\"    For modern Chinese diner and bar Zui Hong Lou's head chef Clement Goh, Sichuan cuisine has become a comfort food. Inspired by it, his menu features Chong Qing chicken wings and Szechuan fries. He says: \"Sichuan cuisine has so much flavour and character and I love the Chinese spices, herbs and numbing sensation of the Sichuan peppercorn.\"    Similarly, for Mr Gervor Quek, 35, owner of Ooh, which sells mala potato and cassava chips, it was a love of mala food that inspired his creation of spicy snacks.    He says: \"The chips are inspired by a dish at Sichuan restaurant Lao Sichuan, where the potatoes are sliced and fried, and served like la zi ji (mala fried chicken). I tried doing it at home and now I work with a factory to produce the chips.    \"Customers have also requested mala fish skin and fried crab stick and I'm working on managing the spice levels for those who like it less or more spicy.\"    • Follow Eunice Quek on Twitter @STEuniceQ   New mala spin-offs   MALA POTATO AND CASSAVA CHIPS    What: Mala chips are the new, highly addictive snack that packs a spicy punch.

Chinese department store Yue Hwa Chinese Products has a wide selection available, with more than 20 brands, says its supermarket supervisor Lim Min Yen. It has outlets in locations including Northpoint City, Jurong Point and Chinatown.    Some popular brands include Hai Di Lao, Xiao Fei Yang (Little Sheep), Huang Fei Hong and Bai Wei Zhai. To use, pour the seasoning, spice and oil into a pot, add water and bring to a boil.    The seasoning to make la zi ji (Sichuan mala fried chicken) or to stir-fry your own mala xiang guo is also available.    Alternatively, Si Chuan Dou Hua's executive Sichuan chef Zeng Feng recommends making your own mala sauce from scratch to \"replicate authentic flavours\".    He says: \"One can use a variety of chillies such as dried chilli, chilli powder and fresh chilli, combined with peppercorn variants such as fresh peppercorn, peppercorn powder or peppercorn oil.    \"It is important to balance the 'ma' (tongue-numbing) and 'la' (spicy) proportions or the resulting 'mala' flavour will not be well-balanced.\"   Halal mala xiang guo   Savouring mala xiang guo - a stir-fried version of mala hotpot - is no longer restricted to the Chinatown enclave.    The popular dish, where diners pick ingredients to be fried in a fiery mala sauce, has been available since mala xiang guo stalls started opening in foodcourts and hawker centres a few years ago.    Since 2015, halal mala xiang guo stalls have been emerging. Under foodcourt operator Kopitiam, there are six outlets, including Cantine at Paya Lebar Square, Bagus at Northpoint City and Kopitiam at SingPost Centre.    On the introduction of halal mala xiang guo stalls, Mr Vincent Cheong, Kopitiam's corporate communications manager, says: \"There is an increasing demand for a wider variety of halal food and mala xiang guo was identified as one of the popular food types.\"    Prices start at $1 for 100g of vegetables. Three spice levels are available - mild, normal and extra spicy. While condiments for the mala sauce used to stir-fry the ingredients are typically spices and herbs, the main difference, Mr Cheong says, is the replacement of pork lard oil with margarine oil.","contentWithMarkup":"It is clear that Singaporeans like it hot, tongue-numbingly hot.
