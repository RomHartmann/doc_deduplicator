Saturday’s events in Jack Kilby Square started at 8:30 a.m., when people gathered in the park for some Pilates and Hatha Yoga. There were inflatables and jumbo yard games — including a large Battleship game — as well as vendors, live music and other entertainment into the night.  Events weren’t limited to the courthouse square. There was a horseshoe tournament Saturday at Brit Spaugh Park, for example. After classic car owners cruised Main Street Friday evening, they drove to the airport for a car show. From the Barton County Historical Society to the Great Bend Public Library to the Model Association of Central Kansas (MACK) airport, Great Bend had something for everyone this weekend.","contentWithMarkup":"Jaunt got underway Friday in Great Bend and continued with activities and entertainment throughout the weekend.
