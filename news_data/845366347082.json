{"sequenceId":"845366347082","id":"34207239882","language":"English","title":"EDITORIAL: Shop local this summer","content":"This is the start of the summer shopping season and the time of year when people shop for their home, high school graduate and spend a little extra money on a night out or weekend get-together.      And this is also the time of year when community-oriented newspapers urge you to shop at home.      We all know the reason for shopping at home – when you spend money locally it strengthens the local economy.      But do you really know the numbers?      For every $100 spent in locally-owned, independent businesses, $68 returns to the community through, taxes, payroll and other expenditures. Spending that same $100 in an out of town mall gains us virtually nothing.      And we want to urge our local businesses to shop locally for services and materials for your business. That same 68-percent return on every dollar spent applies to you, too.      A story we researched and published in this newspaper two years ago said, if every shopper in Chickasaw County would spend $50 extra dollars in local businesses this month we would see our local economy turn around this summer.      We also want to point out with gasoline at $2.69 a gallon it costs a minimum of $20 to get to Tupelo and back. That can eat into any kind of alleged savings from shopping out of town.      Now can everything you need and want be purchased in this town? Of course not.      But we do encourage you to give local businesses that first shot at your summertime dollar.      We ask you to think about it another way.      What three locally owned businesses or companies would you miss if they closed?      The last couple of years have been tough on hometown businesses. They truly are the bread-and-butter of the local economy. They want your business – they need your business!      We encourage you to stop in. Say hello. Pick up something that brings a smile. Your purchases are what keeps those businesses around.","contentWithMarkup":"This is the start of the summer shopping season and the time of year when people shop for their home, high school graduate and spend a little extra money on a night out or weekend get-together.
