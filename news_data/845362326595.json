Astronomers recently took a close look at trans-Neptunian object 2015 BP 519, a body that lies about 450 astronomical units (93 million miles x 450), at its maximum point, from the sun. It is inclined about 54 degrees to the orbital plane.    According to the paper produced by these astronomers, 2015 BP 519 has the largest semi-major axis of any object discovered by a particular sky survey, and the highest inclination of any trans-Neptunian object of that distance from the sun.    This team of researchers ran myriad scenarios to explain 2015 BP 519’s position in the solar system as we know it, at the present time. What they discovered was there is no way to explain the object’s orbit with our current knowledge of the solar system.         Put Planet Nine into the scenario, however, and the data fits.    Planet Nine would need to be about 10 times the Earth’s mass and about 700 AU from the sun in order for everything to check out. An earlier analysis by the University of Bern in Switzerland determined the likely conditions of the planet if it exists.    The paper notes that more objects similar to 2015 BP 519 will still need to be found to corroborate more evidence for the existence of Planet Nine.","contentWithMarkup":"The behavior of an object in our solar system has given newfound evidence to the belief that there may be a large planet somewhere far out beyond the sun.
