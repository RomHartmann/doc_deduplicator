Video footage appeared to show John Hubbard, 61, pulling the gun.    Officers said they were called at 12.21pm local time to the sound of a shot fired, Hawaii News Now reported.    The alleged victim Ethan Edwards, 32, told police he had returned to the lower Puna area to check his house.    Since the recent volcano eruption many people have evacuated but some stayed to protect their homes in case they were looted.    Talmadge Magno, of Hawaii County Civil Defense, told Hawaii News Now tensions were running high.    He said: \"They've got this live volcano in their backyard.    \"They feel like, they see strange people in their subdivision, whether it's people just wanted to go see lava or criminals, and they try to protect stuff.    \"I could see it coming. I know it's something that happens in a lot of disasters, whether it's in the shelters or in the communities. A lot of stress, a lot of things are going on there. It's a hard time for those folks still in there.\"","contentWithMarkup":"Police arrested a man accused of threatening a neighbour with a gun and shooting it in a lava ravaged part of Hawaii.
