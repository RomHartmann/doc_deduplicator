President Donald Trump left the White House Friday afternoon for a weekend at the presidential retreat in Maryland. The first lady, meanwhile, is staying put at the White House this weekend.  On May 14, she was checked into Walter Reed National Military Medical Center for what her spokeswoman Stephanie Grisham described in a news release as \"an embolization procedure to treat a benign kidney condition.\"  The procedure was \"successful and there were no complications,\" per Grisham, but Trump stayed in the hospital for nearly a week.  She has not been seen publicly since the early hours of May 10, when she joined the President at Andrews Air Force Base to welcome three American detainees home from North Korea. She has, however, posted on social media multiple times since the procedure.  The absence of the intensely private first lady has prompted widespread speculation and conspiracy theories.  \"I see the media is working overtime speculating where I am & what I'm doing. Rest assured, I'm here at the @WhiteHouse w my family, feeling great, & working hard on behalf of children & the American people!\" she tweeted earlier this week.  Some say the language and tone of the tweet does not sound like Melania at all, and instead sounds more like something her husband would write.  It's unclear when Trump will make a public appearance, but Grisham insisted Friday, \"She is fine, she's doing great.\"  By Betsy Klein and Kate Bennett, CNN  The-CNN-Wire  ™ & © 2018 Cable News Network, Inc., a Time Warner Company.
