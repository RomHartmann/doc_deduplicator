The lemonade stand, put on by the Voll family, will benefit childhood cancer research through Alex's Lemonade Stand Foundation (ALSF).  Krissy Voll started the lemonade stand four years ago after hearing about ALSF on the Today Show. She thought it was a good way to teach her son about giving back.  During the first year of doing the lemonade stand, the Voll family learned that two of their neighbors are childhood cancer survivors and now they honor and celebrate them during this event every year.  Last year they raised $1,200. This year their goal is to beat that.
