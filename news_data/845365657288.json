{"sequenceId":"845365657288","id":"34207221033","language":"English","title":"Prosecutor asks full court to rehear double jeopardy case","content":"LAKE CHARLES, La.    A Louisiana prosecutor is asking the federal appeals court in New Orleans to reinstate a man's third conviction in the murder of a 6-year-old boy in 1992.    A three-judge panel ruled last month that double jeopardy should have prevented trial on the second-degree murder charge against Ricky Langley.    District Attorney John DeRosier (duh-ROH-zyay) tells The American Press the Louisiana Attorney General's Office joined his request for a hearing by all 17 judges of the 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals.    A jury convicted Langley of second-degree murder in 2003, acquitting him on a capital charge in Jeremy Guillory's death. That verdict was overturned because of judicial misconduct.    A judge convicted Langley in 2009.    The 5th Circuit said the capital murder acquittal also prevented retrial for second-degree murder, because either required proof that Langley meant to kill or seriously injure Guillory.","contentWithMarkup":"LAKE CHARLES, La.
