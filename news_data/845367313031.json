Derek Montgomery for MPR News  At political party gatherings on Saturday, Republican activists picked Hennepin County Commissioner Jeff Johnson to carry their party’s banner this fall, while Democrats continued to battle out their endorsement into the evening.    Roughly 2,000 Republican activists gathered in Duluth ultimately rallied around Johnson’s campaign for governor. Johnson, the party’s 2014 nominee, said President Donald Trump’s near-win of Minnesota in 2016 provides Republicans a road map to win a statewide race for the first time since 2006.    “Donald Trump didn’t win because he was angry. He won because he gave hope to all the forgotten Americans who thought no one cared about them in government anymore,” Johnson said, described by his campaign as the “grassroots choice” in the race. “And there are a lot of forgotten Minnesotans, too.”    He beat Woodbury Mayor Mary Giuliani Stephens and Republican activist Phillip Parrish after three ballots. But Johnson faces a primary challenge in former Republican Gov. Tim Pawlenty, who did not attend the convention in Duluth and will head straight to the August 14 contest. Pawlenty was the source of many broadsides from the stage at the GOP convention, as his campaign aides stood in the wing of the convention hall. The former two-term governor said he entered the race too late to realistically compete for endorsement and would take his chances with a bigger pool of voters this August.    “We are going to get outspent by Pawlenty in a primary,” Johnson said after his victory. “But as long as I have enough to get a simple message out to Minnesotans we will win this race on August 14th.”    In Rochester, roughly 1,400 DFL delegates were stretching beyond four ballots in their attempt to pick between U.S. Rep. Tim Walz, State Auditor Rebecca Otto and state Rep. Erin Murphy.    Otto was forced to drop out of the endorsement race after the second ballot, failing to get at least 10 percent of the vote to stay in the race. Murphy was leading the race after three ballots with 52 percent of the vote to Walz’s 46 percent, but on the fourth ballot, Walz and Otto joined forces to push for a non-endorsement at the convention. By the fifth ballot, Murphy had 54 percent of the vote, needing 60 percent to win the endorsement, but no endorsement held 43 percent of the vote.     If that position prevails, it would mark the first time in the history of the DFL Party that activists didn’t back a statewide candidate at their convention and could mean at least a three-way primary between all of the candidates in August.    DFL Party Chairman Ken Martin urged activists not to let the party leave the convention without endorsing a candidate. He noted a strategic reason: The party cannot spend any money for a non endorsed candidate or in the event there is no endorsement, meaning they would have to sit out the race until after the primary election.    “We cannot wait until August 14 to start taking on Tim Pawlenty,” he said. “Let’s work through this, let’s slog through this. Let’s come out of this convention unified.”     Amy Engebretson of St. Paul is a vocal Erin Murphy supporter Saturday, June 2, 2018 at the state DFL convention in Rochester, Minn. Murphy is campaigning for the DFL gubernatorial endorsement. Jerry Olson for MPR News   Murphy, a former House majority leader and nurse by trade, picked up a number of endorsements from the more progressive wing of the party heading into the convention. In her speech to delegates, Murphy positioned herself as an uncompromising, fresh voice for governor, saying it’s no longer the time for “tippy-toe politics.”    “My family taught me about a powerful kind of politics, the kind of politics that improves people’s lives,” Murphy said. “It’s why I have spent 12 years all over the state of Minnesota, learning about us and what makes us tick. Twelve years have taught me that we care about each other, and we need to we stand up for each other and fight for each other.”    Walz, a geography teacher from Mankato who has served in the 1st Congressional District since 2006, was losing his voice after several days of campaigning. But he used his speech to assure the group of hard-core activists that he has a progressive record while also winning votes in conservative-leaning areas like his southern Minnesota congressional district.    “In a district that voted for Donald Trump by 15 points, I campaigned in favor of your right to marry whomever you love, and we won. I voted for cap and trade to fight climate change, and we won. I voted for the Affordable Care Act in a Republican wave year…and we won,” he told the crowd. “My voting record is so pro-choice, even Nancy Pelosi asked me to tone it down.”    Otto has been state auditor since 2006 and served one term in the state House. She is running on a policy platform of legalizing recreational marijuana, campaign finance reform, single-payer healthcare and tougher environmental protections. Her speech, which ran long, repeated her campaign slogan: “We can do better and we must do better.”    “We shouldn’t be the party of big money, we should be the party of big ideas,” Otto said. “We should be the party that inspires people to go to the polls. That’s how we win.”    DFL Gov. Mark Dayton is stepping down next year, leaving the seat wide open this fall, and there’s a lot at stake for both parties. Democrats have come to appreciate the power of the governor’s office, with Dayton blocking plenty of policies sent to him by Republican majorities in the Legislature in recent years. Republicans haven’t held the governor’s office in nearly a decade, but they currently control the Legislature, and if they maintain their majority this fall and win the governor’s office, they are poised to control all state government for the first time in the modern era of politics.    “This is the most important election in my political lifetime,” Dayton said to the crowd, reflecting on a political career that has spanned 40 years and included time as state auditor, a stint in the U.S. Senate and two terms in the governor’s office. “This is an election for the soul of Minnesota. This last legislative session we saw what a Republican governor and a Republican legislature would do in Minnesota if given the chance.”    Ahead of the governor’s contest, both parties held endorsing contests for other constitutional offices. The Republican Party backed its candidates for state auditor, attorneyDFL Party Chairman Ken Martin warned that primary challengers should know that “they’re taking on the full party, and we’re going to make sure that we defend and protect our endorsements.” general and secretary of state. The candidates for all three are former legislators: Pam Myhra, Doug Wardlow and John Howe.    “I won’t be auditing any of you. And the office won’t be auditing any of you,” Myhra, a former Republican legislator who is running for auditor in an open seat. “The office will be auditing for you.”    On the DFL side, incumbent, three-term Attorney General Lori Swanson surprisingly dropped out of the race for the DFL endorsement after a strong first-ballot showing from newcomer and DFL activist Matt Pelikan.    He noted a past Swanson endorsement from the NRA and criticized her role in several key lawsuits, including her decision to drop the lawsuit against the Trump administration’s travel ban. Pelikan said Swanson settled for too little in a state lawsuit against 3M, which netted $850 million.    “Progressive leadership means picking the fights that need fighting and sticking it out until the end,” Pelikan said in his speech.    Swanson, who considered running for governor until earlier this year, didn’t address the convention before balloting. But a number of her supporters approached the podium to nominate her, including former Attorney General Mike Hatch, who called her “the best attorney general in the nation.” He criticized Pelikan for lack of experience. “You can’t sit in the wading pool and think you can swim in the ocean,” Hatch said.    Swanson is considering her options going forward, including potentially jumping back into the race for governor.
