NantWorks will be exhibiting at booth #7147 during the event.      “New data shows that matched targeted therapy may result in responses for patients with rare and ultra-rare tumors,” said Patrick Soon-Shiong, MD, founder of NantWorks. “We look forward to sharing these results as we continue on our path to building a future of personalized and improved care.”    Presentation Details    Genomic Landscape of Diverse Rare Tumors: Next-Generation Sequencing of Paired DNA and RNA analysis , Abstract #12114  WHO: NantHealth, LLC and NantOmics, LLC  WHAT: Tumor Biology Session  WHEN: June 4, 1:15-4:45 PM CST  WHERE: Hall A, McCormick Place    Presentation Summary    The 286 patients involved in this study had been diagnosed with rare tumor diagnoses. Somatic-specific variants were identified using paired tumor/normal comprehensive NGS. Analysis was focused on the 200 most frequently mutated genes in this cohort, and deep whole transcriptomic sequencing was used to determine expression of observed somatic variants. The results found that most patients with rare and ultra-rare cancers had theoretically tractable alteration, yet not all the DNA alterations were seen in RNA level, indicating potential silencing at the RNA level.    About NantHealth, Inc.    NantHealth, Inc., a member of the NantWorks ecosystem of companies, is a next-generation, evidence-based, personalized healthcare company enabling improved patient outcomes and more effective treatment decisions for critical illnesses. NantHealth's unique systems-based approach to personalized healthcare applies novel diagnostics tailored to the specific molecular profiles of patient tissue and integrates this molecular data in a clinical setting with large-scale, real-time biometric signal and phenotypic data to track patient outcomes and deliver precision medicine. For nearly a decade, NantHealth has developed an adaptive learning system that integrates our unique molecular profiling solution, software and hardware. Our system infrastructure collects, indexes, analyzes and interprets billions of molecular, clinical, operational and financial data points derived from novel and traditional sources to continuously improve decision-making and optimize our clinical pathways and decision algorithms over time.

About NantOmics    NantOmics, a member of the NantWorks ecosystem of companies, delivers molecular diagnostic capabilities with the intent of providing actionable intelligence and molecularly driven decision support for cancer patients and their providers at the point of care. NantOmics is the first molecular diagnostics company to pioneer an integrated approach to unearthing the genomic and proteomic variances that initiate and drive cancer, by analyzing both normal and tumor cells from the same patient and following identified variances through from DNA to RNA to protein to drug. NantOmics has a highly scalable cloud-based infrastructure capable of storing and processing thousands of genomes a day, computing genomic variances in near real-time, and correlating proteomic pathway analysis with quantitative multi-plexed protein expression analysis from the same micro-dissected tumor sample used for genomic analysis.
