DA Craig Stedman told us that and it was in the videos he showed when the police chased 18-year-old Jose Efrain Rodriguez for four minutes and then executed him. (Stedman states in the video that he would prefer “stationary” cameras – and he is a board member of the Safety Coalition – this man will say anything! Click  here for the LNP article and video).         And the cameras pan or rotate pretty quickly so it’s hard to believe that between two cameras they did not catch a peek of the city hall arsonist(s). But besides that it would be nice if this “update” included answers to the following:    —  Have they figured out what accelerant was used to start the fires? They had to use a lot to get concrete to burn/scar  – so depending on the accelerant – in what kind of container was it carried to the two arsons and where would they purchase a large quantity of the accelerant?    —  What did they use to ignite the accelerant? Did they leave any evidence behind – matches, a lighter or a fire igniter?    —  Do they know which fire was started first? The one in the city owned vehicle or the one in the entrance to city hall?    —  One of the cameras in the area has to have caught someone walking towards city hall with a large container or exiting a vehicle near city hall. I do not believe the cameras are that bad/slow to rotate! Yes, the police better keep looking!         Maybe LNP could do a better follow-up and ask the police some actual, detailed questions?   AND LIKE EVERYTHING   STEINMAN – THEY’RE A FRAUD!             We have so many cameras and most of them are utterly useless. Even an attack on city hall, where there’s camera at the corners of the street, is caught unseen.          What exactly is the point of the safety coalition again? Ridiculous.   Posted on Lancaster Online as a comment under the story, “Police continue to go through video surveillance in Lancaster City Hall arson investigation,” (click  here).        I’ve been questioning these cameras for years and suddenly we learn the cameras are on a “preprogrammed, panning zoom” and are apparently worthless! Unbelievable.","contentWithMarkup":"<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"color: #000080; font-family: Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: medium;\">*    Actually, we know the cameras rotate or pan an area.
