The group has been testing the water both from and around the lake, to get an idea of the nutrient levels in the water and the effectiveness of some of the ongoing projects to help bring those nutrient levels down. While the phosphorus levels are still fairly high, there are a few things that are looking promising.  \"Our treatment trains continue to work year after year, continually reducing nutrient concentration, and it's been surprising just how much more they can actually capture this particular spring,\" said Dr. Jacquemin, Associate Professor of Biology for Wright State University Lake Campus. \"They're removing an excess of 50 even 60 percent of the nitrogen and phosphorus as a set amount that comes in from the tributaries.\"  Collecting this data is vital, says Dr. Jacquemin, to continue work on the lake.  \"There’s a long way to go, and unless we have a baseline of data, it will be very difficult or challenging, even impossible, to try and figure out if the needle has been moved at all towards an improved state,\" Dr. Jacquemin. \"That’s what we’re doing this summer - working with some of these restoration projects and at the same time, we are trying to establish a very solid baseline of information.\"  More data will be collected throughout the summer by Wright State Lake Campus.","contentWithMarkup":"For the last few years, the Wright State Lake Campus has been involved with monitoring and testing the Grand Lake St. Marys Watershed, and Dr. Stephen Jacquemin from the university gave an update to the Lake Improvement Association on some of the things they have been able to find.
