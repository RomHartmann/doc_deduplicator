(WDBJ7) -- The Fifth Congressional Republican District committee has a new nominee.    Members of the Republican Party met for a special election to choose the person who will run for the open 5th District Congressional seat as Congressman Tom Garrett chose not to run for re-election.    \"Here is what our commitment was, full transparency for the entire process. We also felt it was important to stick to the rules,\" said committee chairman Melvin Adams.    GOP members stepped up to vote for one among a half dozen candidates. Chairman Melvin Adams says this event was important and sparked engagement from several young Republicans.    \"What's exciting to me is that we have so much youthful energy and passion. That bodes very well for Republicans in the Fifth District,\" Adams said.    Three rounds of voting left just two, Cynthia Dunbar and Denver Riggleman. In the end, Riggleman was chosen.    \"How does it feel to win today? The first time I won was when I met my wife in 1986. It doesn't feel that good, but it feels pretty good,\" Riggleman said.     Riggleman says he has work to do, he plan to meet with all local committees and begin campaigning.    \"It's my first time doing this. I have a lot to learn. I have to get out there, but I have a good feeling about this. I'm not too worried, it's not how I'm wired anyway.\"    Riggleman now has his eyes set on defeating Leslie Cockburn in November.","contentWithMarkup":"NELSON CO., Va.
