{"sequenceId":"845366087485","id":"34207231800","language":"English","title":"Meier: Get ready for county fair season","content":"Spring planting is basically complete in northern Illinois. The temperatures were in the 90s this weekend with humidity to match, a few of those days where you break a sweat merely by breathing — not the most friendly of days for cattle and humans, but it sure gave the crops a good jump on growth.    Crops are looking very good right now. We’ve had timely rains thus far. However, total accumulation has been extremely varied throughout the region. Corn is looking good. Haven’t seen any lightning bugs here yet, but I imagine they will be coming as I am hearing of them not too far south of us, which means it won’t be long until we will be watching for the first rootworm hatch. Soybeans are looking great. Those planted last week are coming up and growing fast. We are starting to see wheat heading out in the area, as well.    We have a number of ag events starting up in the month of June in StephensonCounty. Mark your calendars for the Stephenson County Ag Breakfast Saturday June 16 at the fairgrounds in Freeport. Early ticketing is available at the Stephenson County Farm Bureau Office. Sunday, June 24, in downtown Freeport is the Dairy Day Parade at 1:30 p.m.       Rounding out June and kicking off the county fair season is the Stephenson County Fair June 27 through July 1. Advance tickets are on sale now. Get your tickets early and save with new package pricing through June 16. This year’s fair will feature Rice Bull Riding Co. pro bulls and barrels, Midwest Summer Nationals tractor, truck and mini rod pulls, Rodney Atkins with special guests Back Country Roads and The Derby Icons demolition derby, all in the FHN Grandstands. Make sure you get out and support these great ag outreach opportunities to the community and consumers.    Enjoy this week and stay safe out there on the farm and roadways.","contentWithMarkup":"Spring planting is basically complete in northern Illinois.
