I’m told that last summer, McConnell planned to drop a week or two from the August recess to work on legislative matters (probably the budget).  When the Democrats caved, McConnell proposed staying anyway to do nominations.    His caucus was not amused.

McConnell can threaten to work the Senate harder, but if the Democrats believe his caucus isn’t willing to work, they can call his bluff.  That seems to be part of what’s going on.
