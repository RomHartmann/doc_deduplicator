Her Majesty visited the racecourse on the same day the country was celebrating the 65th anniversary of her Coronation in 1953.    Embed from Getty Images    The 16-1 shot Masar won The Derby beating Dee Ex Bee into second place and Roaring Lion into third.    The winning rider was William Buick. After winning the race he said: “I’ve dreamt of this moment ever since I wanted to be a jockey.”    Masar is owned by His Highness Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum.    Winning trainer Charlie Appleby said: “I’m delighted for His Highness Sheikh Mohammed. Firstly for giving me the position to be here.    “I’ve always said when I started this job I wanted to be the first person to have a Derby winner in Godolphin blue.”    It is an occasion that Her Majesty never misses, however, she has never owned a winning horse as of yet.    Today’s visit was extra special because it was 65 years ago when she was coronated at Westminster Abbey.    The Queen currently has won over 1,600 races making her one of the most successful racehorse owners in history. She has had 10 runners in The Derby, the first in 1953 and the latest was in 2011 when Carlton House finished 3rd.    However, it is the one classic race that she has yet to win. The closest she has been to winning the race was in her coronation year, 1953, when Aureole finished second to Pinza.
