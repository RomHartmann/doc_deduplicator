If accurate, both moves are a pretty radical shift from the 2017 origin story blockbuster, which was set in Europe during World War I. If the sequel follows the format of the first film, it could also include a bookend scenes set during the present day.    The first Wonder Woman movie also starred Chris Pine, Robin Wright, Danny Huston, David Thewlis, Connie Nielsen, Elena Anaya, Ewen Bremner, Lucy Davis, Lisa Loven Kongsli, Saïd Taghmaoui and Eugene Brave Rock and brought in $821 million at the global box office. Rumors about the film's setting surfaced a year ago, claiming it will take place during the tail end of the Cold War and see Diana battling against the Soviets. All kidding aside, it will be interesting to see how pop culture meshes into the film's narrative. Gal Gadot played the title role in last summer's Wonder Woman and will return as the princess of Themyscira.    The sequel to DC's Wonder Woman isn't due for another year but a new update has potentially confirmed what year in history Diana Prince will find herself in. It was originally scheduled to premiere on December 13, 2019, but the bigwigs chose to move it up to avoid competing with Star Wars: Episode IX .","contentWithMarkup":"Now, the film's own executive producer seemingly confirms such speculation.
