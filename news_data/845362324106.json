{"sequenceId":"845362324106","id":"34207115161","language":"English","title":"Arrest made in pursuit, crash that injured Ada detective","content":"Hours after playing an instrumental role in the apprehension of four armed robbery suspects Friday, Ada Police Detective Brian Engel was seriously injured when his patrol car crashed while pursuing a stolen car through Byng.    Ada Public Information Director Lisa Bratcher said Engel was on his way home from work at about 6:40 p.m. Friday when he spotted a car with what he believed was an altered temporary tag near Broadway Avenue and J.A. Richardson Loop. The tag displayed a purchase date that would not arrive for another two weeks. Engel attempted to stop the car but the driver fled north on Broadway Avenue.    Bratcher said Engel pursued the car, described as a 2014 Nissan \"model AS2,\" down Broadway Avenue through the town of Byng, with speeds at times exceeding 100 mph. As the pursuit reached the sharp curve west at North Main Street and state Highway 3E, Bratcher said, the suspect's vehicle barely negotiated the turn traveling through a soft grassy area on the side of the road, while Engel's patrol car did not.    Engel called for assistance and was transported to Mercy Hospital Ada where he was treated for a broken nose, broken ribs and a possible arm injury. Law enforcement personnel from multiple agencies descended upon the area and immediately began a search for the suspect's vehicle.    The suspect's vehicle was found and the driver identified as Leslie J. Warledo, 49. Two unidentified females were also found in the vehicle, but authorities said they were not considered suspects and, after cooperating with investigators, they have been released. Further investigation revealed the car was reported stolen in Chickasha.    Warledo fled the vehicle on foot and was apprehended around 12:30 a.m. Saturday at a home in a wooded area approximately one mile north of the accident scene. He is currently being held at the Pontotoc County Justice Center in lieu of a $250,000 bond and will face multiple charges, Bratcher said.         Warledo has a lengthy criminal history dating as far back as 1987, with multiple burglary convictions and at least one robbery conviction, according to Oklahoma Department of Corrections offender records.    Engel is expected to make a full recovery.","contentWithMarkup":"Hours after playing an instrumental role in the apprehension of four armed robbery suspects Friday, Ada Police Detective Brian Engel was seriously injured when his patrol car crashed while pursuing a stolen car through Byng.
