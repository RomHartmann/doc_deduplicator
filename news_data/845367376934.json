Mrs RM and I spent the afternoon with the lovely Southworths, seemingly recovered from their evening with BRAPA, who seems tightlipped about the event.       Dick and Dave leave our lovely country tomorrow, returning to the welcoming bosom of President Trump and lots of cool, fizzy beer.  We left our two favourite cask dinosaurs at Kings Cross,       but only after a last pint in the Scottish Stores, my favourite pub not in the Beer Guide.       More to the point, BRAPA's favourite not in the Guide, and that counts for a lot.  And also because the other GBG pubs round the Cross (as the kids call it) are dreary.  It looked as pubby as ever; a rambling, historic place for everyone avoiding that station pub (we'd all been in that one for a free wee).  Good beer range too.       Mrs RM took her Oyster Stout to the last free table, took a sip, put it on the middle of the table.  And it slid right off.  SMASH !     Dave took the photo at the top. Forensic experts may detect the slope, but our explanation cut no ice with the bar staff who overruled the first lady we spoke to and refused to give us a free replacement.  Simon would have loved the furore.  A shame, because that Oyster Stout was the best beer in London today(NBSS 4).  But how could I ever recommend for the Guide a pub with sloping tables ?","contentWithMarkup":"<span style=\"display:inline !important;float:none;background-color:transparent;color:#3d596d;cursor:text;font-family:'Noto Serif', Georgia, 'Times New Roman', Times, serif;font-size:16px;font-style:normal;font-variant:normal;font-weight:400;letter-spacing:normal;line-height:19.2px;orphans:2;text-align:left;text-decoration:none;text-indent:0;text-transform:none;white-space:normal;word-spacing:0;\">I'm told my lack of chronological authenticity is a problem for some, so with that in mind here's a report from 8.24pm tonight.  2.15pm to 8.23pm can go hang.</span>\n\nMrs RM and I spent the afternoon with the lovely <a href=\"http://retiredmartin.com/2017/10/25/hunting-high-and-low-for-dick-dave-in-bewdley/\"><strong>Southworths</strong></a>, seemingly recovered from their evening with BRAPA, who seems tightlipped about the event.\n\n \n\n\n\nDick and Dave leave our lovely country tomorrow, returning to the welcoming bosom of President Trump and lots of cool, fizzy beer.\n\nWe left our two favourite cask dinosaurs at Kings Cross,\n\n \n\n\n\nbut only after a last pint in the <a href=\"http://retiredmartin.com/2016/03/30/scottish-stores-kings-cross/\"><strong>Scottish Stores</strong></a>, my favourite pub not in the Beer Guide.\n\n \n\n\n\nMore to the point, <a href=\"https://brapa-4500.blogspot.com/2017/05/brapa-bucks-iv-heading-out-east.html\"><strong>BRAPA's favourite not in the Guide</strong></a>, and that counts for a lot.  And also because the other GBG pubs round the Cross (<em>as the kids call it</em>) are dreary.\n\nIt looked as pubby as ever; a rambling, historic place for everyone avoiding <a href=\"http://retiredmartin.com/2017/06/22/queueing-for-beer/\"><em><strong>that</strong></em></a> station pub (<em>we'd all been in that one for a free wee</em>).\n\nGood beer range too.\n\n \n\n\n\nMrs RM took her Oyster Stout to the last free table, took a sip, put it on the middle of the table.  <strong>And it slid right off</strong>.\n\n<strong>SMASH !   </strong>\n\nDave took the photo at the top.
