The ministers of the six non-U.S. members of the Group of Seven industrialized nations -- the host Canada, along with France, Germany, the U.K., Italy and Japan -- issued a joint statement excluding the U.S., and conveying their \"unanimous concern and disappointment\" with the U.S. decision last week to impose tariffs on steel and aluminum imported from the European Union, Canada and Mexico.   U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, speaking to reporters after the meetings, acknowledged the split, saying \"there was clearly a consensus from the rest of them\" on the issue of trade, adding that he had discussed the meetings on Friday with President Trump. Despite the clash on trade, however, Mr. Mnuchin said: \"There were many, many areas, not only do we agree on, we're completely united on.\"   Rarely has the G-7, a club of industrialized nations formed around common interests, issued such strong condemnation of one of its members. Even more unlikely is the fact that the target of the criticism is the U.S., which has done more than any other country to establish the free-trade principles upon which the global economy functions today.   A frequent theme among the non-U.S. members was their distaste over Washington's justifying its tariffs on national-security grounds. The White House has said the tariffs imposed last week -- 25% on steel and 10% on aluminum -- were designed to address the role steel imports have played in undermining the viability of the U.S. steel industry, without which the country would have difficulty mobilizing for its defense.   The Trump administration has signaled its intention to use a similar security argument to affix tariffs to cars from Germany and Japan, and industrial supplies from China. It also used the national-security argument to impose tariffs on steel imports from Canada, its neighbor to the north.   \"Our absolute view is that this is absurd to think that Canada could in any way be a security risk to the United States,\" Canadian Finance Minister Bill Morneau told reporters at the conference.   The six nations issued the joint statement despite the presence of Mr. Mnuchin. The aim of the gathering, the communiqué said, \"should be to restore collaborative partnerships to promote free, fair, predictable and mutually beneficial trade.\"   The statement, released by Canada, said that \"collaboration and cooperation has been put at risk by [U.S.] trade actions against other members.\"   The strong language sets the stage for a difficult meeting in one week when the heads of state of the G-7 will meet in Charlevoix, Canada, signaling a clear intention of other member nations to confront the U.S. about its recent trade policies.   French Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire quipped to reporters that the meeting in Whistler was the \"G-6 plus one,\" with the clear implication that the U.S. was on the outside.   Mr. Mnuchin denied the U.S. was left outside the consensus on all matters, and insisted Washington is playing a central role in the group: \"I don't think in any way the U.S. is abandoning its leadership in the global economy,\" Mr. Mnuchin said.   \"These are our most important allies,\" Mr. Mnuchin said. \"We've had longstanding relationships with all these countries that are very important across all different aspects.\"   The meeting in this mountain resort town in British Columbia was designed for ministerial-level representatives of each country's government to set a common agenda ahead of the heads of state meeting next week.   And yet, in session after session, Mr. Mnuchin bore the brunt of criticism for the Trump administration's unilateral move to impose tariffs on the other members of the G-7.   \"We can say the U.S. went into the tariff issue alone and they remain alone around the table,\" said Mário Centeno, the Portuguese finance minister who participates at the G-7 by virtue of being the president of the Eurogroup, the association of eurozone finance ministers, in an interview.
