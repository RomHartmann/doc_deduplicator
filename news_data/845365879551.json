Roustan, Sun Sentinel)     For many children between the ages of 6 and 18 this was a first-time adventure, but there were some veteran boys and girls on board too.    Big brother Andrew Cilla brought Isaiah, 11, on his 26-foot boat for a fourth year.    “It’s more about having fun,” Cilla said. “We ride around and all the kids operate the boat and I think they enjoy that more than fishing.”    Adam Covit, 39, has a unique perspective because he entered the program when he was 8 years old as a little brother and grew to become a big brother.    “As a kid it was very rewarding, I had fun,” he said. “As an adult it’s more rewarding to give back.”    Mike Stocker / Sun Sentinel  Lindsay Bohlen and her Little Sister Kendranique Hughes, 8, get ready to go fishing.

Taking the top prize was not a first for Chafe, though, who started in the tournament when she was 6.    “I have won for biggest fish three times before,” she said. “My first fish was a horse mackerel about 15 feet.”    Weller is throttling back his involvement after 39 years. He’s handing over the controls to Trevor Carroll, who has been participating for the past 10 years.    “We’ve seen a very steady growth,” Carroll said. “But I think the biggest thing we’ve seen, really, is not leaving any kids on the dock, and that’s important.”    It means getting more boat owners and captains to volunteer their vessels and gear every year, he said.    “We’d like to get it to where we can invite more and more kids,” he said. “We’d like to see more growth.”    Big Brothers Big Sisters of America describes the century-old organization as the largest donor and volunteer supported mentoring network for children facing adversity.
