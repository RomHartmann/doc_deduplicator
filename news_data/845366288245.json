It also has piled up $89,000 worth of legal fees to date, due largely to the actions of one member, and the figure is likely to rise substantially.     From July 2016 to April 2017, the board paid the law firm of Phelps Dunbar more than $31,000 to defend the system in a harassment suit.    In February of this year, the board paid another firm, Berrigan Litchfield, nearly $58,000 to investigate allegations against then-Superintendent Isaac Joseph.       Legal fees are a part of doing business for a system that employs nearly 7,000 people and has almost 50,000 students spread across 90 schools. The school system budgets about $1 million annually for legal services. But these latest fees are unique in that they stem directly from actions taken by one person.    Bombastic board member Cedric Floyd is at the center of both, having been accused of the harassment and having prompted the investigation into Joseph's conduct.     In the harassment case, former board secretary Sharon Hunter filed an Equal Employment Opportunity Commission complaint and later sued the school system and the board in 2017, alleging that the administration had refused to protect her from Floyd's harassment.    Hunter claimed Floyd barraged her with text messages and phone calls, including outside of work time, and that he isolated her from other employees and bullied her.     The individual board members, including Floyd, were dismissed from the suit, but Hunter's complaint against the administration remained. The School Board voted in April to settle the suit, paying Hunter $60,000.    Floyd has consistently denied any wrongdoing in connection with the case. On Tuesday, however, the board will vote on a motion to censure him for the \"inappropriate conduct\" detailed in Hunter's suit.    To date, the school system has paid out $31,824.26 to Phelps Dunbar to defend the suit, but the last bill was dated April 2017. Board President Mark Morgan said he expects that bill to go up.     \"Prior to settlement negotiations, attorneys' fees were approaching $75,000,\" he said. \"But I don't know what the final bill is.\"    Court records show that more than 70 documents were filed in the court case after that last bill.    In 2015, the board paid attorney I. Harold Koretzky $26,000 to investigate Hunter's claims. The board then declined to consider the lawyer's report, which remained secret until it was filed as part of Hunter's lawsuit and reported on by The Advocate.    The investigation into Joseph also was prompted by Floyd, who said in August that he thought Joseph may have violated board policy and state law. In September, the board hired Berrigan Litchfield to look into the allegations. The firm's report was completed early this year. Berrigan Litchfield submitted a single bill for the investigation in February, spelling out the 297.7 hours that firm employees spent working on the project, plus costs for incidentals.       The school system has refused to release the report, citing attorney-client privilege.    Joseph has never seen a copy of it.     \"I have not received an official copy of the report,\" he said. Attorneys for the board told him they didn't have to give him a copy, he said.     Nevertheless, the entire investigation was a sham, Joseph said.    \"It was a smear campaign,\" he said. The allegations, which Joseph said he had seen, \"were all frivolous.\"    Nevertheless, the charges also likely spelled the end of Joseph's tenure. The first African-American superintendent of the Jefferson system, Joseph was hired by a fractious board in 2015, with Floyd as one of his main champions. But after his first 18-month contract expired, he was not awarded any performance-based bonuses, and the board voted to give him only another 18-month contract.     Late last year, it became apparent that some members of the board wanted Joseph gone. And when Floyd moved to suspend him pending the outcome of the investigation, it became clear that Joseph had lost the support of his former ally.     More legal bills are likely coming. At its May meeting, the board voted to hire Phelps Dunbar to defend it in a second harassment suit based on Floyd's actions. The board also voted to hire a second attorney, Randall Kleinman, to represent Joseph and Floyd in that same suit.","contentWithMarkup":"The periodic controversies that have dogged the Jefferson Parish School Board over the past two years have cost the school district's board more than just a lot of time and attention.
