(WCIV) —   It wasn't the typical field trip for some Berkeley Middle School students. They spent Friday morning playing kickball at the Joe Riley Stadium.    The seventh and eighth graders are part of BMS's Unified program, which is made up of general education students and students with special needs for physical education, art and music.    A few Riverdogs players joined the P.E. class on the field.    \"It shows me that no one is different and that through anything, you can do it. You don't have to meet anyone's standards except yours and you can do it, no matter what,\" said eighth grade student Isabelle Matkovich, who serves as a leader in the classes. \"I've worked with every single kid and this taught me so much patience and how to use kind words and be a leader, not a boss.\"    For their P.E. class, it's not about keeping score, but about exercising the message of inclusion and acceptance.    Sarah Anderson was on the sidelines photographing the game. Her daughter is a leader in the program, so she also came to watch.    \"This is what she wants to do, she wants to be a special needs teacher and it's given her the opportunity to develop those skills now,\" Anderson said. \"As much as this program does for the special needs students, I think it does more for the general student population. My daughter has transformed. The sense of community and inclusion that it creates and the leader that it has brought out in her has just been amazing. It makes me cry every time I watch her interact.\"    The Special Olympics has recognized BMS's work to promote and grow a positive environment on campus. In April, the organization honored them as a Unified Champion Banner School. It's one of only two middle schools awarded the recognition in the state.","contentWithMarkup":"Charleston, S.C.
