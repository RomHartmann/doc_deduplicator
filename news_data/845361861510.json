(ST)    By Our Reporter  SHILLONG: Around 500 people, mostly women and children, from Punjabi Lane took shelter at Garrison ground as the situation at Motphran and the adjoining areas remained volatile on Saturday.  The Army opened its gates to the people and gave them food and blankets. The General Commanding Officer of 101 Area, Lt Gen DS Ahuja, visited the families on Friday evening to take stock of the situation.  Speaking to media persons, Ahuja said the state government on Friday evening had requested assistance from the Army in the form of a flag march.  “The flag march had a soothing effect and on Saturday afternoon, the Army was derequisitioned and it was conveyed to us that the situation is under control,” said Ahuja.  Talking about the people taking refuge, Ahuja said the army welcomed all but “…the state administration needs to look into these issues and ensure that they are comfortable in their respective homes rather than coming and seeking help from the army”.  Meanwhile, Jeet Kaur a woman taking shelter with her newborn baby said she did not know anything but headed to the ground for her child’s safety.  “Nobody cared for us, nobody asked for us and I came here as I know I will be safe under the protection of the Army,” she said.  Another person, J Pandit, lauded the army for providing assistance to them.","contentWithMarkup":"Pia Ahuja, wife of General Commanding Officer of 101 Area Lt Gen DS Ahuja interacts with the people who had taken refuge at Garrison ground here on Saturday.
