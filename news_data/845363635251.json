But this is not the type of heat I am actually referring to. Our June will go something like this: Meeting/End of year party Work day Possible work days.... Possible meet up with friends..... Meeting to turn in forms and pick up stuff Work Travel/Church Camp/Junior Staff Everyone returns Junior Staff/VBS/mom gets a few hours alone! Possible free days Summer Camp Yesterday, I took the oldest for his pre-participation physical. I came home and made copies of his stuff so he could take one to the meeting next week to get it updated. I took his old forms and looked and in the last year he has officially grown 2.5\" and 10 pounds! I got tickled yesterday when the nurse asked \"does he feel anything not right when he does exercise or physical activity?\" Before I could give any \"No answer\" he simply said \"No, I feel the same if I run a 5 minute mile or an 8 minute mile.\" Overall he's in good health mentally and physically. No issues to be addressed. Except pushing an immunization. I am not convinced on this one yet and this is the 2nd year I have said no. I'm not trying to be an ass or anything but it is fairly new and they are still doing \"studies\" and every year something is said \"like now....if you don't get it by 15 then you have to have 3 doses versus now only 2.\" and the \"what we are finding is those reactions that were posted on facebook are not increasing\" Ummm yeah not convinced yet.","contentWithMarkup":"Here we go.....it's hot.
