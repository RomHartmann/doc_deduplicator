{"sequenceId":"845363496976","id":"34207153499","language":"English","title":"THE WAY WE WERE: Uncovering the stories of old pictures","content":"Captured forever in this unique and undated photograph are two former associate members in Toronto’s transportation community, Gray Coach and Wardair. Unfortunately both of these once iconic Canadian companies would succumb to business pressures and are no longer in existence. Wardair was started by Max Ward in the early 1950s and grew out of his love for flying in Canada’s north. First as a freight and charter airline and then, after years of confrontations with the federal government, as a true schedule airline, Wardair serving both foreign and domestic destinations quickly became a favourite of thousands of Canadian travelers. For a variety of reasons operations ended in 1990 just months after Wardair was purchase by Canadian Airlines a company that in turn was acquired by Air Canada. Gray Coach was introduced by the TTC in 1927 as its suburban and sightseeing bus affiliate. The company remained in business until the TTC decided to concentrate on its core urban transit service selling Gray Coach to Stagecoach Holdings of Great Britain in 1990 which three years later sold the remnants of Gray Coach to Greyhound Lines of Canada.     I’ve been studying my city’s fascinating history for more than a half-a-century, first as a mere hobby and in recent years, after leaving the 9 to 5 real job world, as a sort of business with a few dollars income gleaned from royalties paid the numerous books I have authored (many still available through Amazon and abebooks.com ) as well as from this column one that I have contributed to the Sun since the early 1970s.    Over that time I have received, and continue to receive old newspaper clippings, postcards, books and photos, all of which feature material that in some way refers to Toronto’s past.    With these “collectibles” threatening to bury me in my home office every so often I will go through the donated material and scan much of it into an electronic format to minimize the space it takes up as well as to preserve items that would, over time, fade into nothingness.    While most items arrive with a simple message such as, “My late mother, a longtime Torontonian, would like you to have this,” or a more straight-to-the-point suggestion like, “Enjoy!” most items arrive anonymously making subsequent investigation into any details related to the items difficult — especially photos.    That’s where research comes in and often fascinating stories are revealed.    The two photos accompanying this column are examples of items I received without background details. That’s when the fun began, unveiling their stories.    Although this photo is not particularly clear it remains unique in that it shows one of the cityâs earliest public transit vehicles, the Toronto Street Railway Companyâs horsecar #260, a four-wheel, 10-foot long vehicle built in 1890 in the company’s front St. E. shop northbound on Church St. just south of the lineâs terminus at Bloor. Records reveal that this route was inaugurated in 1881. It would become the first city route to be converted to electric operation, an event that occurred with great pomp and ceremony on August 15, 1892. I would like to suggest that this photo was taken by an amateur photographer out for a walk on Church St. and simply turned and âsnappedâ this view on an his âKodakâ camera a revolutionary instrument that George Eastman had introduced to the public in 1888 just a few years before this image was taken.    mfiley@postmedia.ca     Kathleen Wynne: I know I won't win provincial election","contentWithMarkup":"Captured forever in this unique and undated photograph are two former associate members in Toronto’s transportation community, Gray Coach and Wardair.
