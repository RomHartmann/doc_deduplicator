Don't get me wrong — I love seeing colour on other people, and I couldn't count the number of times I've nearly bought a bright tee or an accessory that pops, but I never follow through. I've always enjoyed the simplicity and longevity of a mostly-neutral wardrobe. That was, until this week. Let me explain . . .    It all started with Gigi Hadid. Thanks to the genius of her stylist Mimi Cuttrell, all of Gigi's most talked about street style moments this year have had one thing in common — they are monochromatic. Whatever colour she's stepped out in — be it yellow, pink, white, the list goes on! — she's worn it from head-to-toe. This intrigued me. What was is it about wearing one colour she loved? Aside from the fact it continues to make for an amazing style moment . . .    So, because I live life on the edge, I decided to use Fashion Week as an opportunity to try Gigi's outfit formula and subsequently, wear colour (talk about tackling dem fashion fears). Without holding back, I pieced together a string of tonal looks — purple included, wild — to wear this week. As soon as I started to do this, I realised another reason I think Gigi and her stylist are so into the one colour thing . . . it's takes away the guess work or getting dressed. You pick a colour, and wear it from head to toe, it really is that simple. And day one of MBFWA reiterated this.    I had planned to wear a blue Rejina Pyo dress, a metallic bag in the same shade and navy blue tortoiseshell earrings. Then, it rained (but really, it felt like snow) and I just couldn't bare the thought of heading out jacketless. I picked a pair of camel pants and built a tonal look around them in all of a minute. It was low-fuss, but high impact. Without sounding dramatic, the outfit formula changed my life. Instead of reverting back to my staple jeans or trusty black linen dress when I don't know what to wear, I'll pick a colour and go tonal.    Read on to see my tonal looks from Australian Fashion Week, and please promise me you will try the formula — you wont regret it.","contentWithMarkup":"Confession: Wearing colour terrifies me.
