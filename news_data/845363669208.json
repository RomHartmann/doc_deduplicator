I tackled my desk.  I organized paperwork by filing a bunch and stacking in a pile more.  This pile I have to figure out a solution for.  I'm handling all of my mother's paperwork so I need to figure out where I'll keep it.  I have it in my top drawer in the file cabinet next to me but the drawer is full.  It's difficult to put more in there.  I'm going to have to figure out where to go with it so it remains convenient. I paid her bills, ordered items she needs, and sent a text to my sisters to ask them to check her stock when they visit.  I've been a bad (ish?) daughter as I haven't visited her.  It started six weeks ago with laryngitis, shifted to a kidney stone (not contagious but I was in too much pain), flu and now upper respiratory crud.  I'm toxic and am not visiting my mother. I worked on my bills, sales info and facebook for writing discussions on this new group I'm on.  I wrote two book reviews and sent them to the person who requested them.  I wrote a blog posting for Witches & Pagans.  I updated my sales spreadsheet. My daughter made lunch so I had lunch with Ken and Vicki.  It was nice to put my feet up and kick back for an hour though my eyes thought they should close and my brain thought it should sleep.  I made it stay awake.  I put the dirty clothes down the laundry chute so Vicki can do laundry. Then I tackled posting eight crochet patterns on Ravelry.  I'm writing this blog and then I get to go back to the story I was working on last night until 2 am.  I'm hoping the flow continues as it was working nicely. My list got handled!  I got a lot done and as I read this I think I deserve a nap... nap or writing... hmmm I'll have to see if the writing goes well. Now I still have a long list of crocheting, writing, editing, and other things to get done.  I'm trying to savor the moment.  I got to throw out two post its! Tomorrow will be prep for breakfast and lunches and then back to my list - I hope.  I'm going to try to take it easy tomorrow and see what mischief I get up to.","contentWithMarkup":"<a href=\"https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-2gHf-Qdfcf8/WxL4Qm4-MZI/AAAAAAAADDY/dnkS3FBIW9U2eewHSO84rhk6QARBlCiLwCLcBGAs/s1600/compilation%2Bof%2Bcovers.jpg\" imageanchor=\"1\" style=\"clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;\"><img border=\"0\" data-original-height=\"1600\" data-original-width=\"1237\" height=\"320\" src=\"https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-2gHf-Qdfcf8/WxL4Qm4-MZI/AAAAAAAADDY/dnkS3FBIW9U2eewHSO84rhk6QARBlCiLwCLcBGAs/s320/compilation%2Bof%2Bcovers.jpg\" width=\"247\" /></a>Last night I wrote until 2 am.  You would think I would be able to sleep in.  Nope, eyes popped open early and while I attempted to sleep some more, I only dozed.  I was still up by 7:30.  I was determined to get things done today. <br /><br />I tackled my desk.  I organized paperwork by filing a bunch and stacking in a pile more.  This pile I have to figure out a solution for.  I'm handling all of my mother's paperwork so I need to figure out where I'll keep it.  I have it in my top drawer in the file cabinet next to me but the drawer is full.  It's difficult to put more in there.  I'm going to have to figure out where to go with it so it remains convenient. <br /><br />I paid her bills, ordered items she needs, and sent a text to my sisters to ask them to check her stock when they visit.  I've been a bad (ish?) daughter as I haven't visited her.  It started six weeks ago with laryngitis, shifted to a kidney stone (not contagious but I was in too much pain), flu and now upper respiratory crud.  I'm toxic and am not visiting my mother. <br /><br />I worked on my bills, sales info and facebook for writing discussions on this new group I'm on.  I wrote two book reviews and sent them to the person who requested them.  I wrote a blog posting for Witches & Pagans.  I updated my sales spreadsheet. <br /><br />My daughter made lunch so I had lunch with Ken and Vicki.  It was nice to put my feet up and kick back for an hour though my eyes thought they should close and my brain thought it should sleep.  I made it stay awake.  I put the dirty clothes down the laundry chute so Vicki can do laundry. <br /><br />Then I tackled posting eight crochet patterns on Ravelry.  I'm writing this blog and then I get to go back to the story I was working on last night until 2 am.  I'm hoping the flow continues as it was working nicely.<br /><br />My list got handled!  I got a lot done and as I read this I think I deserve a nap... nap or writing... hmmm I'll have to see if the writing goes well. <br /><br />Now I still have a long list of crocheting, writing, editing, and other things to get done.  I'm trying to savor the moment.  I got to throw out two post its! <br /><br />Tomorrow will be prep for breakfast and lunches and then back to my list - I hope.  I'm going to try to take it easy tomorrow and see what mischief I get up to.","tags":["crocheting","editing","marketing","social media","to do lists","Writing"],"publishedDate":"2018-06-02T20:09:14Z","harvestDate":"2018-06-02T21:36:34Z","estimatedPublishedDate":"2018-06-02T20:09:14Z","url":"http://ct.moreover.com/?a=34207159428&p=1u0&v=1&x=LltBLDGiJ3ZbXS8fIOX_KQ","originalUrl":"http://dragonsden64.blogspot.com/2018/06/crossing-off.html","commentsUrl":"http://dragonsden64.blogspot.com/2018/06/crossing-off.html#comment-form","outboundUrls":["https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-2gHf-Qdfcf8/WxL4Qm4-MZI/AAAAAAAADDY/dnkS3FBIW9U2eewHSO84rhk6QARBlCiLwCLcBGAs/s1600/compilation%2Bof%2Bcovers.jpg"],"wordCount":"444","dataFormat":"text","duplicateGroupId":"34207159428","media":{"audio":[],"images":[{"url":"https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-2gHf-Qdfcf8/WxL4Qm4-MZI/AAAAAAAADDY/dnkS3FBIW9U2eewHSO84rhk6QARBlCiLwCLcBGAs/s320/compilation%2Bof%2Bcovers.jpg"}],"video":[],"logo":[]},"publishingPlatform":{},"adultLanguage":"false","topics":[],"companies":[{"name":"Story-I Ltd","symbol":"SRY","exchange":"ASX","isin":"AU000000SRY9","titleCount":0,"contentCount":1,"primary":true}],"author":{"name":"Eileen Troemel","publishingPlatform":{}},"licenses":[],"source":{"name":"Dragon's Den","homeUrl":"http://dragonsden64.blogspot.com/","location":{},"feed":{"id":"147103204","name":"Dragon's Den","mediaType":"Blog","publishingPlatform":"Blogger","generator":"Blogger http://www.blogger.com","description":"A conversation about life - mine.
