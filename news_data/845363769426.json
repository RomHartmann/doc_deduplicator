The ballet, “Cinderella and the Glass Slipper,” will take the stage 7 p.m. June 9 and 3 p.m. June 10 at the Decatur High School Theater in partnership with the Wise Performing Arts Guild.    FAIRYTALE COMES TO LIFE – Isichel Perez-Rivero and Hanna Huya, who will play the prince and Cinderella, rehearse for next weekend’s ballet, “Cinderella and the Glass Slipper,” at the Decatur High School Theater. Messenger photo by Joe Duty    Ballet teacher Karen Smith said it’s entertainment for all ages.    “It’s funny, there’s a love story … everyone should find some kind of emotion to relate to,” she said. “Everyone’s familiar with the story, and the movement follows the story, so you don’t have to overthink it.”    Hanna Huya, 18, of Bridgeport will dance the part of Cinderella. She brings 14 years of dancing experience to the stage. Huya graduated from Bridgeport High School last week and will attend the University of Texas at Tyler this fall.    Returning to play the prince is Isichel Perez-Rivero, 20, a Decatur High School graduate. Perez-Rivero performed with the high school flamenco team and with WBMA his senior year. Following graduation, he attended the Pennsylvania Youth Ballet and currently dances with the Pittsburgh Ballet. Smith said the entire studio is excited to welcome him back for this performance.    With more than 100 dancers participating, patrons are sure to see someone they know. The youngest dancers are just 3 years old, while adults also have significant roles.    Laura Blaylock, president of the Wise Performing Arts Guild, has been involved with the productions for 15 years, and has “loved them all.”    “It’s not your typical dance recital,” she said. “It’s a performance. Not only does it give the students the opportunity to dance on stage, but it also brings the arts to our community.    “It lets other people experience the arts and see the talent in Wise County.”    Tickets may be purchased at the door, but to guarantee a seat, buy them online at tututix.com/tickets .
