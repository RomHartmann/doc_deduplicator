Atmospheric conditions and a controlled blast came together Saturday afternoon to create a loud bang that was heard, and felt, throughout the northeast Avalon area.   The boom even reverberated on social media with the hashtag #nlboom.  Newfoundland Hardrock was behind a controlled blast in the Robin Hood Bay Landfill area around 5:30 Saturday afternoon.   A temperature inversion caused the sound to amplify and spread throughout the region.   Environment Canada Meteorologist Derm Kearney says an intense temperature inversion was over the northeast Avalon at the time, meaning that cold air, trapped towards the ground by warmer air above, helped the sound to travel over a broader area and sound much louder than normal.   He says it’s a sharp temperature inversion so any local sound would appear louder and travel farther than sound normally would.   The bang, or series of bangs, was even picked up on Natural Resources Canada seismograph readings.","contentWithMarkup":"The mystery behind the “big bang” has been solved.
