Over 200 people last year were recommended to receive treatment for rabies exposure.    During the summer months Flathead health officials say they field many phone calls about rabies.    \"This is the season we start to see a lot of interaction with those wild animals, and that’s what makes us concerned for rabies,\" said Flathead City-County health officer Hillary Hanson.    A map from 2017 showed Flathead with one confirmed rabid bat and Missoula with two. So far this year Flathead has not had any.    State health officials said from 2013 to 2017 95 animals tested positive for rabies. Bats made up 71 percent while skunks made up 21 percent.    \"A lot of times they are not sure they had an exposure specifically to bats,” said Hanson. “You really can't see a bat bite, it can be very small, so we want to talk to you about where you found the bat -- were you asleep, all those kinds of things, so we can figure out the exposure that occurred.\"    Flathead health officials told NBC Montana the biggest problem they run into is people letting go of the animal they were exposed to. If they cannot test the animal then they have to assume it was rabid and recommend expensive treatment.    \"Keep the bat,” Hanson told NBC Montana. “We do have instructions on our website on how to do that, so that we are able to test it, so you don't automatically have to move forward with getting that post-exposure prophylaxis.\"    They do ask people to euthanize the bat, but it is important to make sure the head is not damaged as that is where they test for rabies from. Last year 24 bats were submitted for testing.    Hanson said you can help prevent rabies by making sure your pets are vaccinated. Then you need to make sure your house is bat-proof, which means holes are filled and screens are in windows.
