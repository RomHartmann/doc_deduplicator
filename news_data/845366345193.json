(WGFL) —   The Marion County Sheriff's Office today released bodycam video from the Forest High School resource officer who responded to an April 20th shooting that left one student wounded.    The 20-minute long video starts with security footage showing a suspect entering the school and running up the stairs carrying a guitar case. It then switches to Deputy Jim Long's bodycam after he and school staff responded to a loud explosion on the second floor of Building 1.    Long first responds to Room 212 where you can see a student writhing and yelling. \"What the hell is that?\" Long says. He tells dispatchers he thinks it was a shooting and tells staff to lock the school down.    About a minute and a half later an administrator lets Long into a room where the suspect, identified as 19-year-old Sky Bouche, already has his hands behind his head, along with teacher Kelly McManis-Panasuk, who is credited for talking Bouche down. There are also students standing around.    \"What the hell?\" Long says. \"Put your hands behind your back.\"    Long asks the suspect if goes to the school.     \"I used to, sir.\"    Bouche tells deputies where he can find his weapons. Deputies would recover a sawed-off shotgun, a tactical vest, gloves and multiple shotgun shells.    \"I'm sorry, sir,\" Bouche says while handcuffed and on his stomach. \"I wasn't raised by the right people.\"    \"Are you kidding me?\" Long says.    Bouche identifies himself.    Long: \"I can't believe this is happening.\"    At one point Long asks Bouche how he got into the school with the shotgun. \"Did you just carry it up here?\"    Bouche says yes.    \"Holy cow!\" Long says.    Bouche, who tells staff he fired one time, faces multiple charges.    \"I'm a lone wolf,\" Bouche tells deputies. \"I gave up after one shot.\"    When asked about the student he shot, Bouche told deputies he shot through the door and wasn't sure the gun would work.    The student who was shot was not identified. Authorities say he's expected to fully recover.","contentWithMarkup":"OCALA, Fla.
