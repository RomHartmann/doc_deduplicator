He says it was an honest mistake, that he didn't realize the image was copyrighted and that he made only $11 on the sale. The $50 transaction took place May 12 at the Gretna Art Walk. When artist Becky Fos found out about it, from the buyer via her ex-husband, she reported it to the Police Department. Fos agreed not to press criminal charges against Roberts. He said he plans to donate some prints of photographs he has taken to a Fos event. Read The Advocate's full story. Artist Becky Fos is surrounded by some of her work hanging in the Magazine Street gallery in New Orleans on June 27, 2017.
