The unfortunate incidence happened around one o clock in the morning of Friday when the deceased whose name was given as Onyinye Aguluka was stabbed in her sleep.    According to the wife of the suspect, Mrs Georgina Aguluka, trouble started when Onyinye ‘s father, Mr Cletus Aguluka came home in the night drunk and asked for his torch.    Mrs Aguluka said his children told him that they don’t know where it was, and he pretended that all was well only for him to wake up around one o clock in the morning, went inside his room and brought out a matchet and stabbed his daughter.    She said it all started when her husband took to drinking.    Confirming the incident, the immediate younger brother of the man, Mr Sabastine Aguluka said that his brother has been molesting people especially members of his family including himself.    The brothers of the deceased who are twins, Sochima and Chidera Aguluka, told Tribune online that they sensed trouble when they ran out of the house midnight because their father always looks for excuses to molest them.
