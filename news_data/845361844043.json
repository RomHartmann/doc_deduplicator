At the time the band said he was unable to perform \"due to a serious family illness\".  In a tweet on Friday his brother, the poet Patrick Jones, said Irene Jones, 81, had died from leukaemia.   \"There's a new bright star in the sky tonight,\" he tweeted.  \"Our dear mother Irene Jones passed away today after a long brave battle with leukaemia.\"  Mrs Jones was the author of two books - a collection of poems called Night Photographs and also Sam's Journey which tells of the protests against the Blackwood bypass from the perspective of her beloved dog.
