{"sequenceId":"845365651429","id":"34207221258","language":"English","title":"We have decided to stan Pete Davidson and Ariana Grande","content":"UTC   When Mashable first learned of the rumored relationship between Saturday Night Live 's Pete Davidson and pop star Ariana Grande, we were baffled. Skeptical, even. Who, how? What's in the water at Studio 8H?    But the couple made it social media official this week and we realized we were suddenly obsessed.    It happened, as John Green once wrote, \"slowly, and then all at once.\" One minute we were saying \"literally what the hell\" and another minute we were coming up with the best portmanteau for their relationship (Peteiana is the cumbersome top option, but there's something to be said for the journalism-nerd moniker \"AP Style\").    We can't say exactly what it is that makes AP Style so alluring, but we have some ideas. It's one of Hollywood's rare age-appropriate pairings, and it's always thrilling to see such seemingly dissimilar people drawn to each other. Grande is a pop princess whose fans have been sweetly cautioning Davidson to \"take care of our girl\" ( her message to LGBTQ+ fans for Pride is lovely).     Davidson is known for being one of SNL 's youngest cast members and for a zero-fucks-given stoner persona. It works. It's the logical followup to Haylor , another ride-or-die whirlwind romance that we were retroactively told was gonna be forever, or go down in flames.    Perhaps it had something to do with this photo of them in Hogwarts robes.    Matching! Hogwarts!! Robes!!! Matching sweaters, the official kind you can buy at the Wizarding World of Harry Potter, with Ariana showing off her longstanding Slytherin pride.     I personally am a, uh, bit of a fan, and I'd be lying if I didn't say matching robes and a Goblet of Wine weren't #relationshipgoals if I've ever seen 'em. And truthfully, most millennials would agree! Harry Potter is awesome, and here are two (very differently) awesome people bonding over this awesome thing!!    On Saturday, we learned that Davidson has two new tattoos in Grande's honor: Her initials on his thumb and the bunny ears from Dangerous Woman just behind his left ear. With anyone else we'd be like \"slow down, sis!\" but we can't get enough of it!     The letters are in a nice font and the bunny ears are cute! (one Twitter user pointed out that Davidson has Bipolar Disorder, which means that he feels emotions with extra strength and this is a very plausible response for him to have to a new relationship) (the same tweet also said we should focus on our own failed relationships, and we sure are!).    Now, we're not stupid. We've seen celebrity couples rise and fall with the tides (or after decades of companionship that prompt us to tweet \"LOVE IS DEAD\" as if we ever believed otherwise). They're like, 24! They got tattoos within weeks! Davidson's ex Cazzie David posted a breezy Instagram from Africa after the relationship went public, and we stan this too!!    If nothing else, we wish these two the best of luck – in fact, good luck to all of you who are trying to make love work in this dumpster fire of a world we live in. You're the real heroes.","contentWithMarkup":"UTC   When Mashable first learned of the rumored relationship between Saturday Night Live 's Pete Davidson and pop star Ariana Grande, we were baffled.
