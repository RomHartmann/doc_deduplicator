Severns, who has been with the district since 1990, is retiring at the end of the school year. She said she became a teacher because she loves the reading, writing and speaking and wanted to help others love them, too.      “Wendy's impact on SPHS and its students is immeasurable,” High School Principal Annette Engeldinger said. “Every SPHS graduate is a better writer, reader, and speaker because of Mrs. Severns -- and that is really everyone because she taught every single ninth-grader in her speech class!”            Severns earned a bachelor’s degree in English and political science at Concordia College, Moorhead, and a master’s degree in curriculum and instruction with an English emphasis at Minnesota State University, Mankato. She taught English and public speaking at Cambridge and Northfield high schools before landing at St. Peter.      Compared to 30 years ago, technology and the pressures have changed education.      “When I started teaching, my life was dittos, typewriters and worksheets,” she said. “I had to pay the Cambridge principal a nickel because he was mad that I wasted a ditto instead of fixing it with a razor blade. Now we have Google Docs, computers and student-based projects.”      In some ways, she said, teachers are not as much working alone.      “When I started, it was sink or swim,” Severns said. “There is less pressure today because you don't feel so alone. In other ways, there is more pressure to make sure your students succeed on standardized tests.”      Meanwhile, students do feel increased pressure to be involved in everything and succeed.      “It is unrealistic to work 20 hours a week, take AP and Advanced classes and be in varsity sports or activities,” Severns said. “Sometimes, it really gets to the kids. There is no time for fun. Fun is important.”            Severns said this is the time to go, as her husband, Roger, is taking a sabbatical year from his job, chairman of the finance department in the college of business at Minnesota State University, Mankato. She said the retirement comes a little early, but she wanted to be healthy when she left the workforce. The couple will travel extensively and enjoy a cottage in Brainerd.      “It is our dream come true,” she said. “I will be practicing my Thoreau and simplify my life on Rice Lake.”      Severns said she will miss the students and colleagues.      “St. Peter has the nicest kids and I had a great time teaching here,” she said. “The staff at the high school is hardworking and compassionate. We are a student-centered staff.”      But she won’t miss grading papers over the holidays and getting up at 5 a.m.      “I have also been told that Sunday nights are the best,” Severns said. “I can finally enjoy Masterpiece Theater without thinking about lesson plans for the week.”","contentWithMarkup":"St. Peter High School English and public speaking teacher Wendy Severns has left her mark on nearly 30 years of high school students.
