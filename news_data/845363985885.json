After it began raining, the victim's friends realized he was no longer on the surface of the water.    They immediately called 911 to get help to search for him.    Indiana Conservation Officers, Monroe County Dive Team, Monroe County Sheriff's Department and Perry-Clear Creek Fire Department all responded, using Side-Scan Sonar in an effort to locate the man.
