{"sequenceId":"845363539300","id":"34207155083","language":"English","title":"APP releases fourth progress report to Sustainability Roadmap: Vision 2020","content":"JAKARTA, Indonesia, Nov. 11, 2013 (Press Release) -Asia Pulp and Paper today releases its fourth update report on its Sustainability Roadmap: Vision 2020. The report provides an overview of the company's work to end deforestation in its supply chain.  On February 5th APP introduced its Forest Conservation Policy (FCP), which saw the introduction of a moratorium on all natural forest clearance pending a series of assessments to determine which parts of its suppliers' concessions are of High Carbon Stock (HCS) and which are of High Conservation Value (HCV), all of which will be protected.   While there have been a limited number of breaches (affecting less than 170 hectares), the causes of which have been addressed, the moratorium continues to be effective, while assessments are ongoing. HCS assessments are set for completion in the first half of 2014, while HCV assessments will be completed by March 2014. As these assessments are completed, Integrated Sustainable Forest Management Plans will be developed that set out the company's strategy for ensuring natural forest is adequately protected.    APP's progress in implementing its policy was recognised by Greenpeace in its APP's Forest Conservation Policy Progress Review, which was released last month. The organisation, which suspended its campaign against APP following the introduction of the FCP, used this review to acknowledge the work that has already taken place, while setting out the challenges that lie ahead.    Aida Greenbury, APP's managing director of sustainability and stakeholder engagement, said: \"We're now nine months into the implementation of the FCP and we're satisfied that things are largely on track.    \"We are working across 2.6m hectares of land, and much of the work we are doing has never been attempted on such a scale. As a result, there are constant challenges and hurdles to overcome but with the help of our stakeholders, we are confident that we will meet our goals of ending deforestation and securing the long term future of Indonesian forests.\"    Click here for the full report.","contentWithMarkup":"JAKARTA, Indonesia, Nov. 11, 2013 (Press Release) -Asia Pulp and Paper today releases its fourth update report on its Sustainability Roadmap: Vision 2020.
