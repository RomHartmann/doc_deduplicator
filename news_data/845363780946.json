MISSOULA, Mont. —    The Missoula Police Department will soon have a new home at 109 N. Catlin St. The department has been dealing with space issues for years.    The new building will house up to 18 detectives, administrative staff and the patrol division.    Chief Mike Brady says they will still have a presence downtown.    “Downtown will still have records people, administrative people, the 24-hour desk will still be downtown, we'll still interact with the court downtown, so all the functions available downtown will still be there,” Brady said.    He says the department is glad to be able to be under one roof and have that camaraderie.    “This allows us to bring officers together and having a better working relationship,” said Brady.    The new building includes new cameras, an evidence room and storage space that allows the department to not have to rent another space.    The move is planned for next week.","contentWithMarkup":"New building where evidence will be stored.    MISSOULA, Mont. —    The Missoula Police Department will soon have a new home at 109 N.
