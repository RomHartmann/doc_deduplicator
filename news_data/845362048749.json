{"sequenceId":"845362048749","id":"34207105845","language":"English","title":"Authors helping authors and LLS","content":"This was my first full week off from work and while I got quite a bit done around the house and in research, not so much in writing. I need to get myself to focus on that. I feel I might have trouble with that until my son goes back to school (even as I write this I get interrupted multiple times and I can't do that when writing I need to be able to focus for hours). We are going to have a busy summer and he is always going to be with me so not much writing I'm afraid.     So this week on my Facebook group pages we have been sharing our websites, Facebook pages, twitter, and Wattpad names so we can follow each other. This is nice as I've found some really interesting things on some of their pages/websites. Sometimes I end up unliking however because it ends up filling my FB feed with people I don't know talking about their own thing and it may be a genre I'm not interested in. I like the idea of sharing our social media to try to get more 'likes' and followers but it's not just for likes and followers I look for interesting articles to share on my own page, or if someone has a book coming out, I share that on my page too. I often wonder if I am the only one that does this though, to me liking each other isn't enough, engaging with others on their pages is what helps. Sharing their finds and their book releases really helps them and encourages them to help others.     I have an author friend that is going to Literary Love Savannah this year and has said she is willing to bring promo items that I've made along with her to put in the swag bags that all reading attendees get. I'm pretty excited about this and I am planning on being part of Literary Love Savannah 2019. It's July of next year giving me plenty of time to come up with great promo items and have new releases. As it is I am planning on having an exclusive short story just for those going to this years. Once they get a promo of mine they will see a code on the back to contact me with and I'll send it out. This will give them a chance to try my writing, which they will fall madly in love with (that's the idea anyway) and encourage them to look at what else I have to offer. This also will get my butt moving on first, writing that short story, and second getting my other stories done so that I have new items to sell to them after the conference is over. Unfortunately the conference is in July meaning I must get my short story written and edited quickly.     This week I also looked at what it takes for copy writing and ISBN numbers. I found a website that explained it pretty well. I will do more research into it but if you click the links you can see what I've found so far. I also had to look up the difference between the 35% royalties and 70% royalties options given by Amazon for self publishers.     I am happy (and a little embarrased because it took so long) to say I am now selling my books through Barns and Noble, iBooks, Kobo, Scribd, EPUB, and Mobi. This is all thanks to Draft2digital. I checked on publishing my books through Amazon but it told me that my books would no longer be published with Createspace (which connects to the Amazon site) and I think I want to stick with that for now while I research the best place to publish paper versions.     Finally this week I didn't get as many books listened to as I have in previous weeks (I ran out of borrows for Hoopla and I have been doing other things than listening to books while I clean the house) I did finish The Elite the second book in the Selection series. The end of it was better than I expected, as I mentioned last week I had to focus on another book for a bit because it became repetitive, turns out I stopped listening just before it got interesting again. I will be listening to the next one (the last in this series). I also finished Ignite, the second book in the Defy series. It was very good all the way through it. I have started on the third, and last in that series Endure, though I'm only on the third chapter right now. I also picked up and finished The Jewel a new series called Lone City that I have started. I will be reading the second in that series as well. I still haven't managed to make myself finish 1000 White Women and am unsure if I'll finish it before it returns. I'm not half way through yet and I still have nine hours to go (having finished almost 6 hours of it) I think it is just too long and is unable to capture my interest enough. I do want to know the ending though, maybe I will cheat and look up some reviews. It is not very often that I find a book I just am not able to finish.  What books are you reading this week? Have any books that you just found yourself unable to finish? See you all next week!
