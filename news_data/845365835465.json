That said, Sheely knows what his team accomplished on Saturday means to so many people in the city.    The Elkhart Memorial Co-Ed Unified Track Team won the first team state title in school history on Saturday in Bloomington, using a team effort to edge second place Merrillville by three points.       \"We had personal bests in every event today,'' Sheely said. \"We had a long jumper that didn't jump that well at regional, but today he beat his personal best by a foot and won his heat for 10 points. That was great for us.''    The Crimson Chargers posted 104 points on the day, while second place Merrillville had 101 and Columbus East came home third with 94.    \"We had a feeling we were in the top six, but we weren't sure where,'' Sheely admitted. \"Most times, the IHSAA will give the top 10 at the end, leading up to the champion. But today, they gave Columbus East in third, then Merrillville in second and finally called us state champions. It made us a little nervous till we heard our name.''    The Crimson Chargers received first place heat finishes from Logan Mullins and Roberto Moto, who each won their individual heats in the long jump, Lexi Patrick in the 100, Julian Williams in the 400 and the girls 400 relay team of Emily Kerson, Trinity Fine, Divi Ponce-Acevado and Tati Ponce-Acevado    Second place finishers for Memorial included Tyler Lehman (400), Brian Ketchum (100) and James Goldsborough (400).    \"We were in seventh place after the 400 and then third after the 100 and 400,'' Sheely said. \"Then we just went up from there.''    As Sheely explained, in Unified track, you earn 10 points if you win your heat, no matter where you are seeded. So even if you finish 31st overall, but win your heat, you earn 10 points.       Sheely, also the boys soccer coach at Memorial, was thrilled to have coached the Chargers to the title. However, he knows it will mean more to others around Elkhart Memorial.    \"I'm not an Elkhart person, I've only been here for a couple of years, but I know how important this title is to a lot of people at Memorial,'' Sheely said. \"This was special for me, but to see Phyllis Tubbs – a Memorial lifer – holding up that trophy ... To me, it was the kids No. 1 and Phyllis 1B.''    The Crimson Chargers finished the meet holding the big trophy, but also helped start it, as Memorial's Carson Hill sang the national anthem to kick the day off.    \"I got a call from the IHSAA on Thursday asking if we knew someone that could sing the anthem,'' Sheely said. \"I knew Carson is in choir, so I told them he could do it and he did a good job. It was something special for sure.''    Perhaps the day was best summed up by Memorial's Lehman, who started every game for the Crimson Chargers football team at quarterback last fall, including two playoff games and the Mangy Lion game against Elkhart Central.    \"This experience has been unbelievably amazing,'' Lehman said. \"I’m just so happy for my teammates and coaches!''","contentWithMarkup":"Todd Sheely freely admits he's not an Elkhart native.
