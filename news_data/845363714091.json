You aren’t the only one though. Crooks are also counting, and getting ready to break into your house while you’re gone.    Whether you’ll be away for two days or two weeks, Vandalia Crime Prevention Officer Holly Estepp said there’s a major key to discourage thieves from breaking in.    “Make it look like someone is home,” she said.    “Make sure all the locks are working correctly in your house,” she continued.    That includes checking windows and all of your doors.    “A thief is going to go to an area where they’re not going to be seen,” Estepp said. “The back door, the back window.”    She said the Vandalia Police Department gets 3 to 7 reports of burglaries or break-ins every month, and one of the biggest reasons is that residents are posting specifics of vacations on social media.    “Make sure that if you want to take pictures, post them when you get back,” Estepp said.    That piece of advice applies even when you’re gone for a few hours.    “Going away to a game in Columbus was enough opportunity for someone to break into someone’s house,” she said, “and it gave them enough time to get what they wanted.”    The department recommends asking trusted neighbors to check in on your home while on vacation, but officers are happy to step in and do the job if you need it.    “We will do as much as we can while you’re gone to make sure everything is okay,” Estepp said.    Other departments offer the same service. If you’re planning on going out of town, reach out to your local police to see if they’ll check your home.","contentWithMarkup":"How to protect your home before hitting the road this summer (File: SBG)      MIAMI VALLEY, Ohio (WKEF/WRGT) – Memorial Day kicked off the summer travel season, and the chances are you’re counting down the days until your vacation.
