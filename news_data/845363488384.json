There is no truth to a report that a black woman made the drastic decision to stop pursuing an education at Harvard because she wanted to denounce her white privilege. If the story sounds wild and crazy that is because it is just that as it is false.    Where did this fake news originate? World News Daily Report published the fake news article on June 2, 2018, reporting that a 24-year-old Harvard black student quit the school because her parents are white and she wanted to denounce her own white privilege. You can read the fake news below.    Photo Credit: World News Daily Report    Cambridge, MA | A 24-year-old Harvard student has decided to quit during her last year of law school for what she believes to be ethical reasons.    Evelyn Matheson, 24, has decided to go public about her decision to boycott her final exams because she did not feel entitled to her estimated $300,000 Harvard law school education because of her white upbringing.    Matheson claims that the reality of her white social status and privilege became unbearable to her as she was about to complete her Harvard law studies.    “Unlike most black folks who have spent their life victims of discrimination, oppression, and poverty, I have had the unfair privilege of having a white upbringing because of my wealthy adoptive white parents that I clearly do not deserve,” Matheson told reporters.    However, there is no truth to the above story. What is the problem with the story to make it false? Of course, there is no legitimate news coverage of such a story actually happening.    A simple search of The Boston Globe comes up with no stories about “Evelyn Matheson.” Additionally, the photograph used in the fake news article can originally be found here . The woman is actually Taylor Dumpson who became the first female African-American president of American University’s student government. She was targeted by a racist backlash and now is fighting back against her troll.    CNN reported that the online attacks against Dumpson began after media coverage of the May 2017 stunt involving bananas with messages written on them. One said, “Harambe Bait,” a reference to the Cincinnati Zoo gorilla killed in 2016 after dragging a child through its enclosure. Another said, “AKA Free,” a shot at the African-American sorority of which Dumpson is a member. Now, she is suing Daily Stormer publisher Andrew Anglin for coordinating the racist “troll storm” against her.    As for the second photograph used in the fake news that can originally be found here . The couple is actually George and Cindy Anthony, the parents of Casey Anthony who was charged with the murder of her daughter, Caylee Anthony, in June 2008. Casey Anthony was acquitted of the murder charge in 2011.    Finally, and most importantly, World News Daily Report carries the following disclaimer :    World News Daily Report assumes all responsibility for the satirical nature of its articles and for the fictional nature of their content. All characters appearing in the articles in this website – even those based on real people – are entirely fictional and any resemblance between them and any person, living, dead or undead, is purely a miracle.
