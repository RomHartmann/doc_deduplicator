Capt James Oculu, 66, was arrested on Thursday night from his home in Bukunjja, Mayunge district by officers from the Chieftaincy of Military Intelligence.      Lt. Amos Nsamba, the UPDF liaisons officer for Busoga region, says that Oculu was deceptively requesting for drugs from hospitals in eastern Uganda on behalf of the UPDF. He explains that after receiving the drugs, Oculu would then sell them cheaply in the community.      According to Nsamba, the suspect also extorted Shs 4.3 million from residents of Mayuge district claiming that he will recruit them into the army. Oculu was reportedly found in possession of fake stamps from the office of the UPDF directorate of medical services and the chieftaincy of personnel and administration.    Nsamba says that Oculu’s luck ran out when the hospital administrators of Soroti, Mbale, and Tororo complained to the UPDF directorate of medical services about the unending drug requests by the UPDF.    The UPDF decided to investigate the matter which led to the arrest of Oculu. Some of the drugs that Oculu requested for include aminophylline, anti-malarial drugs coartem and panadol. Oculu is currently being detained at Magamaga military barracks in Mayuge district awaiting prosecution.
