This is the last thing we talked about, you know?”    Ficarra said, “It was a bookend on the pilot. It’s everything we’ve ever talked about in the original conception of the series. The future is a lot of new territory and really exciting ideas.”   More On This","contentWithMarkup":"By Herb Scribner, Deseret News    It’s unclear when NBC’s hit drama “This Is Us” will end its run.
