Faculty speaker Heather Bates, an English teacher, said she was struck by the class’ constant kindness to their peers and to others.    She listed simple acts of charity members of the class have performed, like staying late at a track meet to measure jumps for another team, offering to take a walk with an upset classmate to help them calm down or helping elderly shoppers return their shopping carts.    She summarized her speech with a quote from American cultural anthropologist Margaret Mead: “Never doubt that a small group of thoughtful, committed citizens can change the world. Indeed, it's the only thing that ever has.”    The 2018 graduates are exactly the kind of people Mead was talking about, Bates said.    “You, the class of 2018, are thoughtful, committed and passionate,” she told them.    Valedictorian Karen Ho said the achievements the class of 2018 has reached are not just for themselves. The graduates also crossed the stage and received their diplomas in honor of students who have not had the same opportunities as the graduates, including victims of oppression or school violence.    “The students of Silver Lake will not be the ones to turn away from your calls to action and your rallies for change,” she said. “To students who have lost so much more than the chance to wear a cap and gown, I hope you know that we are among the many that will fight for you.”    The graduates are:     DUXBURY    Austin Myette    HALIFAX    Alexandra Bachelder, Heidi Banden, Alexander Bejarano,
