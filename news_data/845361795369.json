Podcast: Subscribe and Live Lean 365 days a year with us: Remember, as a Live Leaner, fitness isn’t your life, it’s just apart of your journey. Once again, it all comes down to making smarter choices. Simply follow these 3 tips and you can still party your way to a healthier body. 1. Keep moving before and during the party: This means getting in an awesome workout before the party. Now, while you’re at the party, don’t just sit in a chair all night. To accomplish this, be the networking king or queen at the party by staying on your feet and move around the room. If possible, organize an activity like horse shoes, frisbee, darts, foosball, or ping pong. 2. Avoid the belly busting foods and drinks: Most of these processed party foods are loaded with sugar, salt, and plain old crap! They’re also void of any nutrients and will just make you hungrier throughout the night. So you keep binging. To avoid this, you need healthier options to eat. Become the healthy savior of the party by bringing your own healthy options for everyone to enjoy. This could include healthy homemade dips like guacamole and hummus, homemade free-range hamburgers, a fresh veggie and fruit tray, and even homemade protein muffins or bars. Also, be creative with your burger. Skip the bun and eat it like a hamburger steak. Load it with healthy toppings like onions, tomatoes, avocados, and spinach. For a side, go with a salad. You can never eat too many vegetables, so fill your plate to fill you up. What about dessert? Stick to a refreshing fruit salad like berries, mangos, watermelon, and pineapple. And if you don’t have time to prepare and bring this food, simply have a big meal before you go to the party, so you’re full and content. This will stop you from caving in to all those sugar cravings. 3. Avoid mixing your alcohol with sugary soft drinks (including diet soda) & sugar loaded fruit juice: I’m not going to tell you that you can’t enjoy to a beer, a glass of wine, or your favorite cocktail. Just try to moderate how much you have and make healthier cocktails by mixing zero calorie naturally flavored drinks with my two alcohol choices vodka or tequila. Natural, low calorie mixers include: water, lemon water, club soda, or stevia flavored zero calorie sodas. Also, for the non-drinkers, you’re not doing yourself any fat loss favors by drinking soda, diet soda, or fruit juice instead of alcohol. Diet soda is no better for you than regular soda when it comes to weight loss since the over consumption of artificial sweeteners like sucralose, aspartame, and Ace-K can actually increase your hunger. If you don’t drink alcohol, it’s best to stick with water, lemon water, unsweetened ice tea, or stevia sweetened zero calorie sodas. You can also add a small amount of 100% fruit juice to your water to add some flavor. Bottom Line on partying: You can still enjoy yourself at parties with friends. You can still enjoy alcohol and snacks. Just moderate how much you’re having, and choose to stay active, and eat healthier types of foods. WANT MORE DAILY TIPS ON HOW TO LIVE LEAN?: ? INSTAGRAM: ?
