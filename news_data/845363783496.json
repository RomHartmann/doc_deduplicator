The training consists of different scenarios where firefighters climb up flights of stairs and rescue mannequins    “It’s one of those high risk, low frequency events that we definitely don’t hope for but want to be prepared for if it happens,” said acting Battalion Chief Jeff Kroll.    Sixteen members of the Missoula Fire Department participated in the drills held at Aber Hall on the campus of the University of Montana.    Kroll says it’s a team effort that allows them to do this type of training.    “I think everybody is buying in on this, that if there is an event we're going to respond to this. They want us to be prepared, and we obviously couldn't do this without them, the use of their facility, and we have a bunch of off-duty crews coming in today so other crew can cover calls in the city, so it's been a group effort by everybody,\" said Kroll.    The fire department says it’s difficult to navigate around a high rise, but that’s why the training is crucial.    “We're a jack of all trades, really, and master of none. We're expected to do a lot of different things, and if something happens we're who they call after an event like this. That's why we do it annually -- everybody feels much more comfortable with it,” said Kroll.    The fire department finished the drill in close to 15 minutes, which Kroll says “is pretty good.”","contentWithMarkup":"Firefighters in the hallway during training    MISSOULA, Mont. —    The Missoula Fire Department conducted its annual high-rise training Friday.
