Clustering in the Monadnock Regional Middle/High School cafeteria Saturday morning, perhaps for the last time, they chattered and laughed, took last-minute photos with friends and hugged each other.      Some had stuck decorative maps to their caps. Other bedazzled or painted them, affixing gold or black letters, flowers, glitter and bows.      “A world of possibilities awaits,” read one cap. “It’s been magical, but I’m done,” another.         Others chose messages to remind them of the past.      “Four years later …” said another, referring to the not-inconsiderable time students spend awaiting graduation.      That cap's owner, Katrina Hitaffer, 18, of Swanzey, said she designed it after a favorite childhood show, \"SpongeBob SquarePants.\" She wanted people who read her cap in a distinct voice and to smile, remembering a show they, too, may have grown up with.      Almost all of the teenagers who stood there personalized their caps in some way. Hitaffer said she and her friends have been talking about the messages they’d put on their caps, some of the students drawing inspiration from Pinterest, a popular social media hub for arts and crafts idea.      With moments before the ceremony, class President Brooklyn O’Brien, 17, and her friends lined up for one last photo. The Swanzey resident’s cap spoke of the future she’d have beyond the high school: “A world of possibilities await.”      But as they were instructed to line up for the ceremony, O’Brien thought about the past. She’d grown up with her classmates, she said. Some she’d known since she was a child.      “It’s going to be weird not to see the same people every day,” she said.      The class of 2018 has 91 graduates, according to the district’s graduation booklet, and those who attended Saturday’s ceremony filed out of the cafeteria and onto the football field, their regalia swaying in the gentle breeze.      “You have finally made it,” Principal Lisa Spencer told the teens a short while later.      They, along with their families — who sat in the bleachers and across the lawn — cheered in unison.      The journey to the podium was more difficult for some. This year's John R. Goodnow Award recipient, Tara Lee Kearney, had a difficult junior year, said Andy Harrison, social studies teacher at the school. She lost her father and had to fight the courts to \"simply remain in the Keene area,\" he said. Despite the hardship, Kearney was a model student, an active member of the National Honors Society and an \"all-around nice person,\" Harrison said. She volunteered in El Salvador this past spring and even mentored a 9th-grader who was having a difficult time this past semester.         Other students recognized in the ceremony were valedictorian Joelle LaFreniere and salutatorian Genavieve Lombara. Vicki Mercier, family and consumer science teacher at the school, received this year's Student Government Recognition Award. Steven Streeter, adviser at the school, presented the award to Mercier, saying that she helps girls who can't afford prom dresses find a dress and alters them for free.       One by one, speakers — some from the class of 2018 — told the graduating class to follow their dreams. But Jed Butterfield, a beloved science teacher and commencement speaker, also invited the class to be scientists and observers in their own lives, to seek connections in things that, at first, may not appear to be related. The class selected Butterfield, of Richmond, to speak at the ceremony.      “It is relief to know that we don’t have to be first. We don’t have to win all the time because when a door closes, if you’re observant enough, a window will open. Sometimes we win when other people win,” he told them. “And that’s a paradox.”      Science, he told them, is the search for relationships. And the world, he said, is all about relationships. Everyone, he said, is part of the eco-system, where no one part is more significant or more important than any other part.      “Remember that nothing happens without energy,” he said. “Find your source of energy.”      Class valedictorian LeFreniere encouraged her classmates to aim high. She told them to raise their hands, then asked them to raise their hands higher, and higher. Then she the posed the question: Why didn’t they raise their hands as high as they could the first time?       “After today, we won’t have that second and third chance we’ve always been given,” she said. “No one is perfect, but we know we can always, and should always, raise the bar higher for ourselves.”      Later, when the speeches concluded, the band played its piece and various performers sang graduation songs, and it was time to graduate. As students filed one by one to the stage, their parents and fellow classmates cheered, their voices carrying in the wind.","contentWithMarkup":"SWANZEY CENTER — The soon-to-be graduates may have worn identical green and white regalia, but their personalities shone through on their caps.
