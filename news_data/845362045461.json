The moot will provide a platform to academicians and researchers to share their research-based work related to society-related socio-economic issues. The event is part of university’s activities to promote creativity and innovations in academic pursuits.    “Our vision of 21st century’s higher education is to provide an enabling environment at AIOU for research, innovation and creativity. We believe that besides creation of knowledge, dissemination of knowledge is equally important,” said Vice Chancellor Prof Dr Shahid Siddiqui, adding that AIOU is currently publishing 17 research journals in different fields besides organising a series of workshops, seminars and conferences hosted by various departments and faculties.    The vice chancellor said that he personally invites and welcomes graduate students from all over Pakistan in all fields and disciplines to come and share their research and creative work in the form of presentations, posters and projects.    The conference is being organized by the varsity’s Office of Research Innovation and Commercialization (ORIC) and will be a regular feature to promote research culture in the country.    The graduate forum provides an opportunity for the graduate students (masters and above) to share their research work that has already been finalized or is in the process of finalisation. The conference will be open for students other than the AIOU’s.    The conference will add an extraordinary element of thinking beyond the limits of disciplines and bringing up the ideas of interdisciplinary conversations as well as innovative research ideas. The forum will also help the graduate students in developing their research works into publishable literature. The university will offer a space for inter-disciplinary interaction for developing cross-disciplinary research proposals and to bring innovation in research at the graduate level.
