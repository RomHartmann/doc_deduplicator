Sentiment can drive the equity market in the short run, making stocks a poor indicator of future economic activity. The bond market has much less 'animal spirits' and can often give a good read on future economic growth.    The bond market has many areas including Treasury bonds and corporate bonds. Each market gives off its own signals. Typically, each market will provide similar information but at times, like today, the Treasury market and the corporate bond market can be sending mixed signals.    The Treasury market has been signaling slower growth and lower inflation as evident by the flattening yield curve. The Treasury market does not believe that the current rise in inflation will last and that a reversal towards lower growth and lower inflation is in store by year-end.    Yield Curve Compared To One Year Ago:     Source: YCharts, EPB Macro Research    A more clear picture can be seen in the spreads between various Treasury maturities. Some common spreads that we look at frequently at EPB Macro Research are the 30-year Treasury minus the 3-month Treasury, the 30-year minus the 2-year and the 30-year minus the 5-year Treasury.    The spread between the 30-year bond yield and the 3-month bond yield has fallen to 1.12%, the flattest of this economic expansion.    30 Year - 3 Month Spread:  Source: YCharts, EPB Macro Research    Most analysts use the 10-2 spread as a proxy for future growth and inflation expectations. Using the 30-year Treasury is far more accurate as the longer maturity bonds are increasingly sensitive to growth and inflation expectations.    The 30-2 spread is hovering near a cycle low of 56 basis points.    30-2 Spr ead:  Source: YCharts, EPB Macro Research    The spread between the 30-year yield and the 5-year yield is also near cycle lows, at 30 basis points.    30-5 Spread:  Source: YCharts, EPB Macro Research    The spreads between various Treasury yields are sending a clear-cut signal that these growth and inflation trends in the market today will not last and will, in fact, reverse.    With that being said, it is never a good idea to rely simply on one indicator. The bond market is far more reliable than the stock market in terms of future economic trends. The bond market is very large and contains information outside of Treasury bonds.   The corporate bond market and the difference between yields across the credit spectrum can be equally telling.    My favorite spread to look at in the corporate bond market is the investment grade bond yields [Baa] compared to the junk bond yields [CCC]. This measures the relative performance across the credit spectrum. As this spread widens, lower credit quality bonds are starting to fall faster than higher quality bonds which can be a leading indicator of slowing economic activity.    Baa-CCC Credit Spread:  Source: FRED, EPB Macro Research    Currently, the corporate bond market is sending the 'all clear' signal while the Treasury market is screaming to get defensive based on a flattening yield curve. The Baa-CCC spread, often referred to as the 'Quality Spread' has fallen below the February 2017 low. Although the spread has started to widen in recent days, that is likely due to oil prices ( USO ) falling which I will cover below. Typically, indicators in the credit market move together so when they do not and are sending opposing signals, it is important to drill down and understand why.    At EPB Macro Research, we have been short junk bonds ( JNK ) since August 2017. That trade has been relatively flat since putting it on and was just reduced in size as of this last portfolio update ( click here to get all portfolio updates ).    ( JNK ) Total Return Since August 2017 (Including Dividends):   Source: YCharts, EPB Macro Research    While the trade was not a detractor from the overall portfolio (a small contributor), it was likely oil prices that prevented this from being a more profitable position.    The short in junk bonds ( JNK ) was added on the basis of economic conditions tightening from the Federal Reserve, decelerating economic activity evident in the Treasury bond market and the economic data, and at the time, a widening Quality spread.    Based on the evidence, I expected economic data decelerate into 2018 which it empirically has. Growth is still strong but a notable global growth deceleration is clearly underway by a various metrics in the United States and more clearly in Europe. A wider 'Quality Spread' was expected with the correctly identified global growth slowdown.    Due to geopolitical events keeping a bid under oil prices, junk bonds ( JNK ) with a modest exposure to oil, outperformed as a result.    Oil Prices and Quality Spread:   Source: FRED, YCharts, EPB Macro Research    As the chart above between the Quality spread and oil prices shows, the quality spread was widening (moving lower in the chart) until oil prices started to rise in an accelerating fashion. Oil prices carried the quality spread to tighter levels than February 2017, sending an opposing signal to the Treasury market.    As of the last few days, the Quality spread has widened as oil prices have quietly fallen almost 10% from the recent highs.    When looking into the construction of the Junk bond ETF ( JNK ), we can see the ETF has a direct exposure to energy of roughly 10%.    Junk Bond ETF ( JNK ) Composition:       Source: YCharts, EPB Macro Research    This may not sound like it is a lot and enough to sway the indicator in either direction, but it is once you take into account the second and third order consequences.    First off, oil prices have risen massively, up 60% since last June. Despite energy exposure of roughly 10%, a massive 60% surge in oil prices would cause a dramatic repricing of those bonds that make up the 10% allocation, enough to impact the aggregate ETF.    Furthermore, junk bonds, in general, prefer a high inflationary environment as inflation benefits the debt holders. As oil prices rise and the inflation throughout the economy increases, this provides another benefit to junk bonds.    I have a research note on the rise in oil prices and the impact to inflation which you can read here .    It is very important to understand the divergence between the indicators in the Treasury market and the corporate bond market.    Upon further review, it is clear that high oil prices have artificially boosted junk bond prices to a level they might not otherwise have reached. Had oil prices not risen, the quality spread would have likely continued to move higher as the yield curve flattened further and the economic data continued to decelerate.    Without a proper forecasting on geopolitical events and thus oil prices in the short-term (the long-run forecast for oil is significantly lower), and a clear impact to the quality spread, the junk bond ( JNK ) short position was reduced at EPB Macro Research.    I still believe there is an asymmetric risk in this trade, as evident by the historically low spreads, but as the data shows, the marginal moves in the short-term can largely be driven by oil prices ( USO ). There are better places to deploy capital should oil prices remain high due to lasting geopolitical tensions. Should geopolitical tensions subside and oil prices begin to fall again, the remaining position in this trade will start to perform and spread will likely converge to the other indicators in the bond market.
