There is also the chat functionality that lets you hold synchronous chat sessions while working on a document, spreadsheet, or presentation.  Check out this page to learn more about Google Drive’s collaborative features. 2- Google Hangout This is another great tool from Google that enables you to connect and collaborate with your colleagues in real-time. You can use it for voice or video calls with up to 10 persons. You can also use it for group chat with up to 50 persons.
