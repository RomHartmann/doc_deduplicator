{"sequenceId":"845363787230","id":"34207163204","language":"English","title":"Student Views: Public, private sectors collaborating to advance space exploration","content":"A new space race? Well, less of a race, more of an alliance.    Today we see private space teams tackling huge projects in satellite technology, scientific research and human spaceflight through the power of their mass media marketing. What’s not seen is what’s happening behind the scenes.    Some are labeling this resurgence of interest in space as a race, but the huge efforts from both government agencies such as NASA and private companies are creating an even greater leap in what we know about science. New privately funded technologies and contemporary approaches to research, in addition to a wiser experience and strong foundation, combine to further efforts in meteor excavation, human spaceflight, 3D printing in zero gravity and the multitude of other projects being piloted today. As Smithsonian curator Valerie Neal worded it in an interview, “It’s the voice of reason collaborating with a newer agile outlook.”    Despite the lack of publicity in comparison, NASA isn’t dying out. If anything, it’s growing through the liberty of the private sector. As long as there is a curiosity in the public for outer space and science, our nation’s space program shall prosper.    That curiosity is mirrored throughout the world as programs in the United States begin to thrive. Despite borderlines and politics, space exploration continues to remain secular and teams happily rejoice over any and all milestones, globally. So, for those of you looking into space tourism or living on Mars, there is hope. Space offers endless possibilities as long as we have those brave enough to tackle it.
