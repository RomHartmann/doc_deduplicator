James Schaefer, 79, and Lois Zickrick, 80, were in a 2016 Honda UTV that was travelling northbound on SD Highway 273. The UTV failed to stop at a stop sign at the intersection of SD Highway 1806/BIA 10. The UTV was struck, in the intersection, by a 2017 Hyundai Elantra that was traveling east on SD Highway 1806/BIA10.     Initial observations by law enforcement indicated that Mr. Schaefer was the driver of the UTV. However, that cannot be conclusively determined at this point in the investigation. The investigation will continue to try to determine which occupant was driving the UTV occupied by Schaefer and Zickrick.    Schaefer and Zickrick were both thrown from the UTV and later pronounced dead at the scene. Neither were wearing seatbelts or helmets.    Hope Thompson, 18, was driving the car. She was wearing a seatbelt and suffered minor injuries. Ramsey LaRoche, 19, was the front seat passenger. He was not wearing a seatbelt and received minor injuries. Darla Langdeau was in the backseat. She was wearing a seatbelt and received minor injuries. They were transported to the Chamberlain hospital where they were treated and released.    South Dakota’s Highway Patrol is investigating the crash.     Read or Share this story: https://www.argusleader.com/story/news/2018/06/02/names-released-lyman-county-fatal-crash/656197","contentWithMarkup":"| Updated 4:10 p.m. CT June 2, 2018         CLOSE       Car crash stats for South Dakota.
