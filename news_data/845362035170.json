{"sequenceId":"845362035170","id":"34207105518","language":"English","title":"Keep Farms Preserved","content":"I was happy to see a recent proposal to defund an ag preservation program in Harford County, Maryland, thwarted.    Prime farmland being gobbled up by development is a troubling sight.    Given the region’s population density and development pressures, ag preservation programs are crucial to keeping farmland open in many areas.    Harford County is one of them. Sitting just northeast of Baltimore, the county has seen increased development pressures over the years.    The Bel Air region is largely residential and commercial now, so farming has been relinquished to the northern part of the county. Even that is under increased development pressure.    According to The Aegis newspaper, the county’s first agricultural preservation easement was done in 1977. Since then, 50,000 acres have been preserved. The county itself has preserved nearly 30,000 acres.    But a proposal last month by County Councilman Mike Perrone would have defunded the county’s ag preservation program for 2018-19, shifting it to things of “greater need” including school safety, emergency management services and employee salaries.    The proposal was defeated by the time the county drafted its $734 million budget in late May. The council voted 6-1 to pass with Perrone being the lone dissent.    Politicians routinely target farm preservation programs as a way to balance budgets. Last fall, Pennsylvania’s Republican-controlled Legislature proposed a one-time transfer of $27 million from the state’s ag preservation program to balance the 2017-18 budget.    In Connecticut, the state’s ag preservation program, usually funded yearly with $10 million in state bond money, hasn’t seen new money put in its coffers since 2014.    It’s not an easy job trying to fund government while at the same time dealing with taxpayers who want more services but aren’t willing to pay for it. Farmland preservation programs and other ag programs are easy targets simply because most people aren’t farmers and these programs seemingly affect few people.    But these measures are short-sighted and will potentially lead to higher taxpayer costs in the future.    In Lehigh County, Pennsylvania, another area with intense development pressure, for instance, the county government estimates that for every dollar in property taxes a farm family pays, they use only 36 cents in public services. People living in residential developments, on the other hand, spend more than a dollar’s worth of public services for every dollar they spend on property taxes.    The value of farmland goes beyond just saving government resources and money. Farms can’t exist without land. You can’t feed people’s appetite for more locally grown food without the land to grow crops.    I understand the need for more development. It increases the tax base and brings more money into local communities.    But farmland is too valuable without taking a long, hard look at the consequences of just giving it away.","contentWithMarkup":"I was happy to see a recent proposal to defund an ag preservation program in Harford County, Maryland, thwarted.
