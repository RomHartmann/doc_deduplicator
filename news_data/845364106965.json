The Chattahoochee River National Recreation Area Facebook page posted a warning telling lake and river-goers to use extreme caution following the recent rains, as flow rates and bacteria levels are at an unsafe level.    Flooding can cause the disruption of water purification and sewage disposal systems, overflowing of toxic waste sites, and dislodgement of chemicals previously stored above ground.    Although most floods do not cause serious outbreaks of infectious disease or chemical poisonings, officials warn that it can cause sickness in people who come in contact with the contaminated floodwater. In addition, flooded areas may contain electrical or fire hazards connected with downed power lines.    The post stated that most rivers in the Chattahoochee River Watershed are swollen.     The rain has also forced engines to generate continuously at local dams and will do so for the next two weeks.    But even though the weather is just beginning to warm up, boating and swimming is still not advised.    Young children, the elderly and people with weakened immune systems have a higher chance of getting sick from exposure to bacteria. However, bacteria levels are expected to return to normal within a few weeks after the last rainfall.
