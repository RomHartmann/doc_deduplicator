{"sequenceId":"845367369211","id":"34207264685","language":"English","title":"Kirby: Look smart and you'll sound smarter","content":"If you wear glasses people often think you know the answer.    \"My glasses say a lot about me.\"    — Victoria Beckham    I was in disguise.    It's what I call my \"Clark Kent\" mode, which features a pair of cheap glasses I got at the dollar store. I don't look like me, or at least I don't look like the guy in the little picture on this page.    I look much smarter.    That would explain why people ask my opinion while grocery shopping.    A few days ago, I found myself standing beside an older woman as we both weighed the price advantages of plastic baggies. A smaller size was on sale, but if you looked at the next larger size beside it and counted the contents, you realized that you could achieve the same result by simply buying the larger size.    One sees this a lot at the grocery store, what I call the \"faux sale\" that gives you the appearance of savings.    How many times have you seen someone come in from the store waving a sales receipt and cheerfully announcing, \"Look at all the money I saved.\"    To which, you would like to reply, \"Look at all the money you spent,\" except you don't because you want to stay on her employer's dental plan.    But back to the baggies.    The older woman and I had been studying the various packages and reviewing the prices and doing the cost breakdowns in our heads. We did this quietly, almost like two art connoisseurs studying an abstract painting at a trendy gallery.    Finally, she spoke: \"Why do they make this so hard?\" She said it without looking at me, but I was the only other person in our aisle.    \"To make us buy it,\" I answered. \"This isn't as bad as toilet paper. I can never tell if I'm getting a good deal on toilet paper. The rolls are packaged in too many ways ... and the individual sheets are sometimes thick and sometimes thin.\"    Then thinking I had perhaps gotten a bit too familiar with a perfect stranger, I changed products.    \"Paper towels are the worst,\" I said. \"There are too many variables. You can buy a package the size of a doghouse or you can buy just one roll ... and it's still hard to figure out exactly what you're paying.\"    \"Walmart makes the best paper towels,\" she said, followed by, \"I don't shop there. But they are just the best.\"    \"I always get the half sheets,\" I said. \"It's more versatile. Plain white, too. Not the floral print.\"    \"That's smart,\" she said, turning to push her cart away.    I hear that a lot when I wear glasses.
