Now network is already planning reboot.","content":"ABC’s decision to cancel “Roseanne” will not come cheap, The Hollywood Reporter reported this week, as actors and some show employees will still need to be paid for the show’s entire 13-episode second season, which was soon slated to enter production. But ABC executives are reportedly already considering another reboot of the hit sitcom — with a new star, of course.What are the details? TMZ reported Friday that ABC is exploring the possibility of re-branding the show around lead actress Sara Gilbert’s character, Darlene Conner. Gilbert has reportedly reached out to her fellow cast to gauge interest in a show focused around her character. John Goodman, the show’s lead actor, is reportedly “very interested” in the idea, TMZ reported. Carsey-Werner, the company that produced “Roseanne,” is also on-board with the potential reboot. In a statement this week, ABC executives said they would not order the production of season two of the “Roseanne” reboot. Their decision came hours after Roseanne Barr, the show’s star actress, tweeted a racial epithet toward a former official in the Obama administration. However, according to TMZ, ABC executives are now “desperately trying to salvage the jobs” of the show’s writers and crew. More than 100 people worked on the show, meaning they became unemployed when executives canned future production.  via TheBlaze https://ift.tt/2J9XGC5","contentWithMarkup":"<p>ABC’s decision to cancel “Roseanne” will not come cheap, The Hollywood Reporter <a href=\"https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/live-feed/roseanne-cancellation-aftermath-who-gets-paid-1115881\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">reported this week</a>, as actors and some show employees will still need to be paid for the show’s entire 13-episode second season, which was soon slated to enter production.</p><p>But ABC executives are reportedly already considering another reboot of the hit sitcom — with a new star, of course.</p><h3>What are the details?</h3><p>TMZ <a href=\"http://www.tmz.com/2018/06/01/abc-talking-roseanne-reboot-centered-sara-gilbert-character/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">reported Friday</a> that ABC is exploring the possibility of re-branding the show around lead actress Sara Gilbert’s character, Darlene Conner.</p><p>Gilbert has reportedly reached out to her fellow cast to gauge interest in a show focused around her character.
