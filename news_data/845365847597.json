The agency said 26-year-old Jervaughn A. Bonner was caught after bailing out of the car and hiding in bushes near Interstate 4.    According to the Sheriff’s Office, Bonner was driving a stolen Ford on International Speedway Boulevard just after midnight when the car’s tag was spotted by an automated license plate reader.    Deputies soon saw the car at a red light near Nova Road. When they confronted him and ordered him to put his hands up, Bonner accelerated, ramming into a patrol car as he fled, the Sheriff’s Office said.    In a statement, a sheriff’s spokesman said Bonner had seen and “made eye contact” with the deputies before hitting the gas to escape.    Deputies twice used stop sticks to disable Bonner’s vehicle — deflating the tires on the driver’s side — but he didn’t stop, continuing past Interstate 95 and Tomoka Farms Road at speeds up to 100 mph, officials said.    He struck a guardrail as he entered I-4, but kept driving even as one of the car’s tires came apart and began shooting sparks, deputies said.    Eventually, Bonner drove onto the median and ditched the car, authorities said. He and a 15-year-old passenger ran. She also was discovered hiding in the bushes, the Sheriff’s Office said in a statement.    An agency search dog reportedly found Bonner, biting him on the arm.    He was taken to Halifax Health Medical Center. A mug shot showed Bonner seemingly unconscious and apparently still in treatment, with tubes in his mouth and other medical equipment on his face.    Bonner faces a slew of charges, including grand theft auto, aggravated battery on a law-enforcement officer, child abuse, fleeing law enforcement, interfering with child custody and resisting arrest.    The 15-year-old girl was returned to her mother, while a 4-year-old — who was in the front seat without a seat belt, deputies said — was handed over to the Department of Children and Families, officials said.    Neither of the kids and none of the deputies were hurt.    jeweiner@orlandosentinel.com , 407-420-5171 or @JeffWeinerOS on Twitter    Orlando-area resort apologizes after video shows woman yelling N-word at black guest »       CAPTION    Starflyer debut marks end of years-long saga for high-profile developer Chuck Whittall.       Starflyer debut marks end of years-long saga for high-profile developer Chuck Whittall.         CAPTION    Orange County commissioners are scheduled to hold two canine-related discussions on Tuesday, June 5 - one dealing with a dog-friendly dining ordinance and another that could lead to new rules restricting retail pet sales of dogs and cats.
