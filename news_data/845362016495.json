(File)    JEFFERSON CITY —    Lieutenant Governor Mike Parson dropped the lieutenant from his title.    The 62-year-old small business owner will serve as Missouri's top official, but unlike exiting Gov. Eric Greitens, Parson has more than a decade of experience serving the people of Missouri.    Born and raised on a farm in Hickory County, and residing in Bolivar, the Republican lawmaker has served the Show-Me State in more ways than one.    He served six years in the military police and later turned to a career in law enforcement. Parson eventually became Polk County sheriff in 1993 and served until 2005, when he pivoted to a career in politics.    Serving in the Missouri House of Representatives, he was the chair of the House Rules Committee. After completing three terms as a representative he was later elected a state senator where he served as Majority Whip and chairman for the committee on small business.    Within his 12 years serving his constituents in southwest Missouri, he had notable successes including the expansion of the Castle Doctrine, similar to a stand your ground law. The expansion of the legislation passed in 2013 says a person can use force, including deadly force, to defend themselves at home or on their property and not fear legal retaliation from the perpetrator.    Parson was also the Senate handler of the right to farm amendment, legislation voters approved in 2014 to constitutionally guarantee farmers and ranchers their right to engage in such practices.    Additionally, he sponsored a bill requiring legislative approval before the Missouri State Highway Patrol can spend more than $100,000 on any one item. The law comes in response to a 2013 incident when then-governor Jay Nixon used Highway Patrol vehicle funds to purchase a $5.6 million plane without any public oversight.    Parson has been described as a conservative. On his campaign website he is self-proclaimed \"100 percent pro-life,\" known to be a strong abortion opponent. A supporter of the National Rifle Association, in previous campaign ads he proudly says he is a strong proponent of the second amendment.    Aligning with popular Missouri values, he was elected as the 47th Lieutenant Governor of the state in 2016 with the most votes any Missouri lieutenant governor candidate has ever received.    After taking oath, Parson also became the highest-serving Baptist in Missouri's government, according to faith-based magazine Word & Way . In an interview with the magazine he is quoted saying his beliefs play a role in his decision-making and profession.    It is clear he differs from his fellow Republican Greitens.    According to the Missouri Ethics Commission , he's also the state-elected official who has received the most gifts from lobbyists in 2018.    The list continues, as Parson has said he disagrees with Greitens cuts to higher education and the passage of the Federal Low-Income Housing Tax Credit, a program meant to promote affordable housing.    The main difference lies in Greitens' recent scandal regarding a computer tampering charge and an invasion of privacy charge, stemming from an extramarital affair. A difference that political analysts say has propelled Lt. Gov. Parson to ascend to become the 57th governor of the Show-Me State.    The lieutenant governor said Wednesday his first objective will be to reassure Missourians the state's government is ready to move forward.     \"My commitment to all Missourians is to listen to them and work together to advance the interests of our great state,\" he said.     Parson was sworn into office 5:30 p.m. Friday.","contentWithMarkup":"Missouri's incoming governor, Mike Parson, met with members of the press Tuesday.
