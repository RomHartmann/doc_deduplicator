The goal was to help deepen their understanding of the project and to get them to provide strong backing for its successful implementation.  Ms. Ruby Neils-Palme, the Coordinator, said it had a seed capital of 120 million Canadian dollars and was going to offer direct support to the district and regional offices of the Food and Agriculture Ministry (MOFA) across the country.  The Centre for Scientific and Industrial Research (CSIR), alongside MOFA technical and line managers would also be included. The ultimate aim, she said was to see a modernized, equitable and sustainable agriculture sector that would help to achieve national food security. Ms. Neils-Palme added that it would focus on strengthening extension services at the district, regional and national levels with greater emphasis on market-oriented, climate and gender-smart approaches. It would assist to bring market-oriented agriculture research findings to small holder farmers to boost production.  Mrs. Eugenia Gifty Kusi, the Deputy Regional Minister, said agriculture was one of the key sectors which had kept the economy going. ”That is why the government will take every necessary step to make sure that the sector performs optimally to speed up economic growth” she said. She also made reference to the “Planting for food and jobs” and said it was meant to boost food production, create jobs and stimulate rural industrialization.  The Deputy Minister underlined the need for all stakeholders to pull together to grow the nation’s agriculture.
