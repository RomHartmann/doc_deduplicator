In 2005, Melissa Crouse, now 64, was about to start a new life. Her children had gone off to college, and she started applying for new jobs in Florida, near her brother. One required a physical, and she found out she had lung cancer. She had chemo, and part of her left lung was removed. But the cancer came back, in her liver, in 2009. She’s since been through multiple clinical trials.    Finally, one of them helped. Her tumor tested positive for a genetic alteration called a RET fusion, in which a gene called RET, short for “rearranged during transfection” is turned on all the time by being fused to another gene. A new drug, LOXO-292, targeted this genetic defect. And it made Crouse’s cancer shrink.    “I feel better now than I have in a long time,” Crouse says. She can go to the grocery store instead of ordering them for delivery, and can watch her five-year-old granddaughter while her daughter runs errands. “Things most people take for granted that I just couldn’t do before, now I can do them.”    The new drug is the latest success story in the area of targeted cancer therapy that can help patients with very specific mutations, and the second such drug for LOXO-292’s maker, Loxo Oncology, which is asking the Food and Drug Administration to approve a medicine it developed against a different gene. It also sets up a duel between Loxo and another biotechnology firm, Blueprint Medicines, which showed off data from another RET drug in April.    In data presented at the annual meeting of the American Society of Clinical Oncology in Chicago, 77% of patients with RET-fusions studied (30 with non-small cell lung cancer, 7 with thyroid cancer, and 2 with pancreatic cancer) had their tumors shrink enough on the drug to call it a response. The median response was similar whether the patients had lung cancer or another tumor. Tumors shrank in 45% of 22 patients with medullary thyroid cancer who had mutations in the RET gene.    Alexander Drilon, clinical director in the early drug development service at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, who conducted Loxo’s study and who had offered a critique of Blueprint’s in April, called the results “pretty exciting.” He said it’s too soon to compare the Blueprint and Loxo data sets. (Wall Street is not listening. Loxo shares are up 48% in a month, while Blueprint shares are flat.) Vivek Subbiah from M.D. Anderson, who presented Blueprint data in April at the annual meeting of the American Association for Cancer Research, also declined to compare the two studies. But he did say that he’d had his own experience with Loxo-292, with a patient with a large liver tumor that had failed to respond to many other drugs. Loxo had provided the drug as part of what’s known as a compassionate use trial, a way for patients to get experimental drugs. The tumor responded; when the man could not get the drug because of Hurricane Harvey, tumor levels in his blood increased again. When the drug was re-started, they went back down.    “It seems to work,” Loxo chief executive Josh Bilenker says. He says he’s “optimistic” that there could be an approval path for the patients with RET fusions, where there are no other treatments. But thyroid cancer could be more complicated, he says, because there are already approved drugs. The next step will be to meet with the FDA. Right now, Bilenker says, “We just haven’t had sufficient feedback.”","contentWithMarkup":"<p><strong>By Ellie Kincaid and Matthew Herper</strong><br />\n<!--donotpaginate--></p>\n<div id=\"attachment_17468\" style=\"width: 650px\" class=\"wp-caption\"><a href=\"https://blogs.forbes.com/matthewherper/files/2018/06/M-6208-1.jpeg\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-17468\" src=\"https://blogs.forbes.com/matthewherper/files/2018/06/M-6208-1.jpeg\" alt=\"\" width=\"640\" height=\"427\" srcset=\"https://blogs.forbes.com/matthewherper/files/2018/06/M-6208-1.jpeg 640w, https://blogs.forbes.com/matthewherper/files/2018/06/M-6208-1-300x200.jpeg 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px\" /></a><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Melissa Crouse was helped by a new targeted cancer drug.</p></div>\n<p>In 2005, Melissa Crouse, now 64, was about to start a new life.
