{"sequenceId":"845365515346","id":"34207217757","language":"English","title":"Drive recovery after Windows 8 drive image wrote over good drive","content":"Short version ran Win 8 image BU, attempted to restore (on wrong drive) it failed and now original drive is \"lost\" Whole story: Customer had a drive constantly popping up that Windows needed to backup for a drive issue. 2 months in they give it to me. I scanned and checked, not malware. Chkdsk found nothing. Thought it was one of their office laptops that backups nightly, my bad. Did a Windows 8 drive image. Removed original drive put in new one. Drive image wont run because no OS. No problem. I have ISO's of 8 Pro. Run, errors out \"Not same OS\" type message. Try Win 10 home and pro, same issue. I don't have 8 home ISO. It has now bee 5 days of off and on.  Attach original HDD via USB (left new drive connected via SATA), boot to F8, select recovery (like I have been with ISO). Recovery found. NEVER does it say where it is going to install recovery image. Run, craps out about 45 minutes in, \"Your recovery HDD or image to HDD has an issue run check disk\" or something to that. Backup to the CMD option run chkdsk on sever drives found.  Run again same issue. Now I think, screw this, I'm gonna do something different. I will backup data install new drive, install Windows, you know the long hard way of putting everything back. Shut down, remove new and BU drive. Install original back in SATA, reboot. Turns out the recovery was trying to run on original HDD, now wont boot (want's me to finish the recovery process [which failed 2x] and of course no data backup and of course has Quick-books, \"all\" kids and family pictures on it. Now it's been 8 days. I am trying MiniTool Power Data Recovery, however it is not finding all that I need. What programs have you had success from? Is there one that can recover back to partitions? I am running the recovery SW on a shop PC and the customers HDD is attached via USB.","contentWithMarkup":"<p>Short version ran Win 8 image BU, attempted to restore (on wrong drive) it failed and now original drive is \"lost\"</p><p>Whole story:</p><p>Customer had a drive constantly popping up that Windows needed to backup for a drive issue. 2 months in they give it to me.</p><p>I scanned and checked, not malware.
