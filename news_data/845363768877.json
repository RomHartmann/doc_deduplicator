Messenger photo by Joe Duty    Seven Justin Elementary students were transported to local hospitals from the scene of a school bus rollover on Farm Road 407 near Bill Cook Road Tuesday afternoon.    All seven were treated and released by Tuesday evening.    The single-vehicle accident occurred around 3:15 with the bus leaving the roadway and landing on its right side on the north side of FM 407, approximately six miles west of Justin in Denton County.    “Preliminary investigation indicates a school bus was traveling west on FM 407, when for an as yet undetermined reason, the vehicle’s right tires left the roadway,” said Texas Department of Public Safety spokesman Lonny Haschel. “The driver overcorrected, and the bus overturned coming to rest on its right side.”    The driver was treated at the scene and released.    COMFORTING PRESENCE – Kierston Martz of Justin picks up her daughter from scene of the Northwest bus rollover Wednesday on Farm Road 407. Messenger photo by Joe Duty    According to Northwest ISD Executive Director of Communications Emily Conklin, 18 students were on the bus. The 14 students not transported to the hospital were taken back to Justin Elementary or released to parents.    Conklin did not know the extent of the injuries of the students.    “We always want to be cautious any time there is an accident,” Conklin said. “We had EMS out here as soon as possible. They’ve been great to work with. They did transport [seven] students. We don’t know the extent of the injuries. We hope to hear very soon. We’ve been in contact with their families.”    Northwest ISD Superintendent Ryder Warren thanked first responders for helping at the scene.    “We are truly appreciative for them getting out here so fast and getting the scene under control,” Warren said.    Justin Elementary has students in kindergarten through fifth grade from Justin, New Fairview and East Wise. Northwest ISD is in its final week of class for the school year.    The bus was from Durham Transportation. The district decided in February to move from Durham to contracting with Reliant for bus service starting in the fall. The district has been with Durham since 2001.","contentWithMarkup":"<div style=\"width: 590px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img style=\"border: 0px none;\" title=\"Surveying-the-Scene.jpg\" alt=\"Surveying the Scene\" src=\"http://www.wcmessenger.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Surveying-the-Scene.jpg\" width=\"580\" height=\"364\" border=\"0\" /><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">SURVEYING THE SCENE –  A Department of Public Safety trooper peers inside the Northwest school bus that overturned on Farm Road 407 Tuesday afternoon.
