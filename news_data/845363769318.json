{"sequenceId":"845363769318","id":"34207162342","language":"English","title":"Applewhite takes over constable job","content":"Charles Applewhite officially started his new job as Wise County Precinct 3 constable Thursday after being sworn in by County Judge J.D. Clark.    Charles Applewhite    For Applewhite, the oath was the next step in a long journey as a law enforcement officer. Applewhite has been in law enforcement since 1985. He’s worked in the Walker County Sheriff’s Office, Bedford Police Department, Texas Alcoholic Beverage Commission, Samson Park Police Department and Wise County Sheriff’s Office.    “I’m very humbled. This is a culmination of a lot of years of hard work,” Applewhite said. “I never saw myself doing this. It’s something I decided before I ran, I want to make people proud of this office – not just in that precinct but countywide. I’m going to work as hard as I can and as long as the dear Lord will let me stay in this office and the people will let me stay. I feel like this is a culmination of 30 years of hard work – pain, blood, sweat and tears.”    Applewhite won a runoff for the post May 22 to fill the unexpired term left vacant by the resignation of Doug Parr in August, following his criminal plea deal. The term runs through December 2020. Because the office is vacant and he had no Democratic opponent in November, he could take office immediately.    After filling out paperwork and the county setting up his bonds, Applewhite said he’s ready to get started setting up his office and get to work.    “Getting the office set up and taking the load off the sheriff’s department and doing what I was elected to do,” Applewhite said about his immediate to-do list. “[Justice of the peace Mandy] Hays and I will sit down. We want good communication on how things are going to run.”    Applewhite will need to attend a constable training class. He plans to take part in some training through the Wise County Sheriff’s Office later this month. He can start serving papers and carrying out the other duties of the office before attending the classes.    “I’ve served civil papers before, but it was several years ago,” Applewhite said. “I’m sure some things have changed. I want to get up-to-date on that.    “I have a good rapport with the sheriff’s office and the other constables to answer any questions.”","contentWithMarkup":"<p>Charles Applewhite officially started his new job as Wise County Precinct 3 constable Thursday after being sworn in by County Judge J.D.
