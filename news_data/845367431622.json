{"sequenceId":"845367431622","id":"34207266949","language":"English","title":"Special Memories of our LO's..... Before.","content":"Hi!  I was looking at my Mom sleep, I looked at her little wrinkled hands and thought how hard they've worked over the years.  I thought about them changing my diapers, curling my hair, wiping my tears away and holding me close. I thought about all the grandkids she rocked, bathed and loved. And the patience, smiles and humor with which, she taught us how to raise them.   This brought me to another thought. Just how private she was/is and how humiliated she'd feel if she knew how I told so many strangers, of her late in life struggles.   But I totally believe in people helping people. Sharing our invaluable, experience, strength and hope, compassion, frustrations and grief. In short, I need you guys and I,like you, am not afraid to ask for help. :)   Having said that, our LO's were more then just demented, confused, clueless souls. They lived amazing lives! Even if they were only amazing to us.   So this thread goes beyond the Pampers, poopies, none bathing issues. Beyond the baffling insurance, medical, boundaries and NH questions.   It's a love thread. What was your LO like before? Share a special memory.   Did your Mom forgo meals so you kids could eat? Did your dad teach you something you treasure and utilize to this day? Did your husband work a crappy job to feed the family? Did your auntie put a little light in your world when things weren't so good at home?   Whatever you're proud of, whatever you feel made you're LO awesome....share!  I, for one, would love to know!","contentWithMarkup":"Hi!
