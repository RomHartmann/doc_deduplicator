MONMOUTH — It took plenty of planning to find the right time to surprise Public Defender Tom Siegel with the April Achiever of the Month award. The man has a busy schedule. That small window of time presented itself Thursday morning. Warren County State’s Attorney Andy Doyle, who was in on the plan, conversed with Siegel at the Warren County Courthouse, where they ran into Warren Achievement Center Marketing Coordinator Sean Cavanaugh. Cavanaugh then led Siegel into the courtroom, where he was greeted by Courthouse staff and presented with the award.  Siegel, who has been a public defender since 2006, will serve his last day in the position July 1. He called the award “humbling” and credited Monmouth for shaping who he is.  “The community here has become a part of who I am,” Siegel said. “It’s where I’ve grown up as an attorney. The people here, of course, are what make the community great.”  Cavanaugh, who handed Siegel the award, praised Siegel for serving in his position for over a decade, a position that dealt him constant cases.  “Being a public defender is difficult work,” Cavanaugh said. “They don’t do it for the money, they don’t do it for the recognition. They do it because they truly believe in the process that everyone deserves to be defended in the court of law. For nearly 12 years he’s done that in Warren County and it’s a job that people don’t last 12 years doing because it’s a constant onslaught.”  Doyle said Siegel has served as a mentor to many.  “Tom’s been a teacher to myself and many of the attorneys in the area,” Doyle said. “This award is well deserved. He should be proud he earned it, and he’s a valuable member of our community and the community of attorneys.”","contentWithMarkup":"By Andy Bell-BaltaciReview Atlas      Friday  Jun 1, 2018 at 9:55 PM      It took plenty of planning to find the right time to surprise Public Defender Tom Siegel with the April Achiever of the Month award.
