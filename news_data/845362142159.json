{"sequenceId":"845362142159","id":"34207109202","language":"English","title":"Greitens Resigns but Remains Defiant","content":"David Diaz, Manager,  Davenport Laroche    Embattled Missouri Governor Eric Greitens is done, but he didn’t leave without, once again, getting his message out to anyone who would listen. Greitens, who has been taking a beating in the press thanks to sexual misconduct allegations and invasion of privacy charges related to an affair, has continued to denounce the media and proclaim his defiance.      Now, the governor is facing a multilayered PR crisis involving many terms that make irresistible headlines: assault, threats, invasion of privacy, unwanted sexual contact, corruption, and felony evidence… Both supporters and detractors of the governor were riveted, and Greitens was fast losing ground to stand on.    When the AG released a statement that Greitens would be charged in connection with using a charity donor list for political fundraising without the organization’s knowledge, many wondered what Greitens would say to these new charges. When Hawley said he thought the evidence clearly showed that Greitens had committed a crime “again” that soundbite elicited a strong statement from the governor.       Greitens denounced both the charges and the attorney who brought them: “Anyone who has set foot in a Missouri courtroom knows these allegations are ridiculous… (Hawley) is better at press conferences than the law.”    Hawley, meanwhile, told the media the evidence points directly at culpability related to Greitens. These latest in a string of public relations embarrassments and felony allegations have stripped Greitens of nearly all of his political support. The state GOP has walked away, and once staunch supporters are stunned as the allegations stack up.    That’s when the demands for his resignation reached a pinnacle. Both legislators and top donors called for Greitens to resign. Without support from his party or his funding partners, the governor was left with little choice. Now deposed, he still faces both a legal battle. And, even Greitens wins in court, he still faces an extremely daunting public relations task: rebuilding his reputation as a rising political star.    So far, the public perception is a cycle of allegation, denial, and increasing evidence of both inappropriate and illegal behavior in his personal and public life. Greitens, while admitting to an affair, has denied everything else, dismissing felony charges as ridiculous and choosing strong and defiant PR messaging. There are those who want to believe this narrative, but the available market for it is dwindling fast.     ","contentWithMarkup":"David Diaz, Manager,  Davenport Laroche    Embattled Missouri Governor Eric Greitens is done, but he didn’t leave without, once again, getting his message out to anyone who would listen.
