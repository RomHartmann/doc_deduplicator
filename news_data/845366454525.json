Alyson Ferguson, Coatesville Area Youth Philanthropy Program manager, explained that the 15 high school students made all the decisions, including which organizations to help, and they fulfilled their roles while thinking like a board of directors.    “Over the last nine months we have become a family,” Ferguson said. “This is the most cohesive group I have had. We are really open and transparent about our biases and our differences and we talk about them and celebrate them.”    The Coatesville Area Youth Philanthropy Program, an initiative of the Brandywine Health Foundation, recognized two nonprofits that provide behavioral health and resiliency building programming to the greater Coatesville area. This year they worked with The Point and the Lincoln Center. Each year the youth in the program have $15,000 to disburse to nonprofits they have selected.      The ceremony was held at Citadel Federal Credit Union, at the Thorndale branch in Caln Township, which is a sponsor of the program. Citadel Senior V.P. Michael Schnably told the students that businesses and all environments are filled with “too many rules to remember,” so he lives by two rules that he encourages his employees to follow. The first rule is to always do the right thing. His second rule applies to their parents, which is to “brag as much as you want about your children.”    He told the students that people will look at them differently now because they are leaders and he encouraged them to have confidence in their ideas. He advised them when people offer to help them, let them.    “Together we can do really great things,” he said.    Student Jullian Maurer said she realized how impactful their community service was and they had valuable experiences as they learned about the business world. The program teaches students how to become a philanthropist.    “Coming into the program we all knew about charity and giving back, but now we know it’s about how the outcomes impact others,” student Patrick Mcmanamon said about the philanthropy.    Toni Keg presented each student with a citation from state Sen. Andrew Dinniman, D-19 of West Whiteland. She encouraged the students to continue using their skills to better the community and beyond.    “You worked diligently to discover and serve the needs of your community,” Keg read from the citation.    The students provided funds to the Lincoln Center to provide 200 hours of therapy to help 20 individuals. According to G.T. Freeman, this will be the start of providing counseling assistance in Chester County. The program began in Montgomery County. The Lincoln Center initially focused on drug and alcohol prevention through educational programs for students and occasional in-service training for school personnel and now it has new programs to educate young adults about the dangers of drug and alcohol, according to its website.    Dwayne Walton and Debra Shupp, of The Parkesburg Point, thanked the students for the funding to continue the mission of empowering youth and their families to live victoriously by offering a safe, engaging and spirit-filled environment. Walton said that they enjoy seeing the work ethic of the students who volunteered and how that energy can spread to the youth in the program.    “If we can work with students and get them back to a place where they say, ‘I want to give back to my community,’ that’s a victory for us,” Walton said.
