The North Stars prepared for the exact play in practices leading up to Saturday's game – and it paid off in a 1-0 win over Fremd in Saturday's Class 4A sectional final in Palatine. \"[North coach Tom Poulin] told us: 'That's gonna happen on Saturday. We're gonna have a suicide [squeeze] and we better be ready,'\" Wilson said. Mary Beth Nolan   Caption   With the victory, St. Charles North (20-9) advances to play York, which beat Oak-Park River Forest, in Monday's 6:30 p.m. supersectional in Rosemont. The North Stars, who won their second straight sectional title, seek their first state bid since the 2011 team took second. Grace Quinn reached on a single to start St. Charles North's seventh-inning rally, and Alyssa Domaracki came in as a courtesy runner. Domaracki advanced to second on Sydney Eby's sacrifice bunt, and Olivia Oborne legged out an infield single to put runners on second and third. Mary Beth Nolan   Caption   Wilson got the pitch she wanted, got the bunt down and Domaracki barreled safely home. After a brief conference between the umpire crew, it was affirmed Fremd catcher Lexi D'Ambrosio obstructed Domaracki's path. \"I knew my job, and I did it,\" Wilson said. It set the stage for a rollercoaster bottom of the seventh. North starting pitcher Jillian Waslawski previously navigated through Fremd scoring threats in the sixth and third innings, but the Vikings' bats didn't go quietly. Mary Beth Nolan   Caption   With two outs, Kaylee Goluch fouled off at least seven pitches and survived Quinn dropping the would-be final strike before ripping a single to put two on for Fremd, including a runner at third. After each pitch to Goluch, Waslawski, who struck out four and scattered six hits, took a small walk to the back of the circle before gearing up again for another round. \"Just one pitch at a time. That's been my strategy the whole time because Fremd is a very good-hitting team, and so really, that's what I had to do,\" Waslawski said. Goluch, for her part, spends plenty of time during the summer working on fouling off pitches. The practice evidently paid off. Mary Beth Nolan   Caption   \"I was really stressed in the moment there,\" Goluch said. \"I was like: 'I just gotta get the ball in play...I just gotta hit how I know I can hit; just believe in myself and good things will come.\" Waslawski, though, bore down to retire Fremd's Sophia Crescio on a ground out to end it. North had a great chance to break the scoreless game in the fifth after Eby sprinted out an infield single and Oborne knocked a single to center field. With Wilson at the plate, a passed ball advanced both runners to second and third. Mary Beth Nolan   Caption   Wilson then hit a small comebacker to Fremd pitcher Nikki Kehoe, but Kehoe threw to third after Eby over-committed on her running start and she was tagged out in a rundown. In the sixth, North again had two on, but Waslawski smoked a liner caught at short, which then doubled up the runner at second. A groundout then ended the threat. \"It was two very good pitchers; it was two good defenses,\" Poulin said. \"That's what a sectional championship is supposed to be like.\"","contentWithMarkup":"Mary Beth Nolan   Caption   She simply needed to be ready for the moment.
