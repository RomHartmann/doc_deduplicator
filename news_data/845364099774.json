{"sequenceId":"845364099774","id":"34207173193","language":"English","title":"LiveDataâ€™s edge case: bug or feature?","content":"-   95   I am trying to adopt LiveData for most of my app. My situation is very simple: onActive() triggers a Firestore call that caches the result (or returns it if already cached). I realize LiveData is focused for streams of data, like Firebase Realtime Database with listeners, but it also works great with other kinds of data, like the one I'm using. I can change any value anywhere and all activities will be kept updated.   However, the single problem I'm having is becoming ever more problematic. If I FAST close and open the same activity, the Android lifecycle will occur as follows:   oldActivity: onPause   newActivity: OnCreate   newActivity: onChanged   newActivity: onStart   newActivity: onResume   oldActivity: OnDestroy   By FAST, I mean this: https://imgur.com/a/axWSA (I even made a sample app to demonstrate the problem I am having. It will wait a few seconds, load the data. If I return and open again, it should sum the previous value to one, but if I do it fast, it just returns the previous one, since onActive was not loaded again).   onActive() is not called, because onInactive() was never called (the activity was never destroyed before opened again), so it will return the old value even though I might want it to fetch again from the server. The solution I found was to always call the fetchFromServer function before the observer and on onActive. This way works, but it fetches twice, and the observers get two values, one of them is trash. So it requires additional code to filter what is good, what is not, and trashes all the time I saved while adopting LiveData.   So.. is this the way it was designed for? Is there a better way? Or is this instead a bug that should be fixed by Google? Any help is appreciated.
