{"sequenceId":"845366467809","id":"34207242841","language":"English","title":"On this 46th birthday","content":"a moment to pause and reflect... Moments of gratitude. For a life filled with awesome experiences. For a journey that has had its bumps, twists, and turns. For hugs and laughter shared from sweet friendships along the way. For family who love me unconditionally For a husband who puts up with my antics and loves me through the hiccups, hugs me and says it's going to be alright. The sweet memories of all the adventures this life has given me and the people and friendships forged along its path. For a job that continues to feed my spirit and bring joy to my life and for coworkers who help me, support me, laugh with me, and bring me light. Yes there are moments of sadness today... Waking up and there isn't the first call of the day from her. Mom was usually the first phone call of the day with the birthday song...I am missing her a lot Missing grandparents today as well... But mostly feelings of sweet gratitude for the chance to face another year. For the anticipation of what each corner will bring. Grateful for it all Thank you to each of you for being a part of my adventure. I am grateful to you all for the part you have played in it all. Carry on, my fellow sojourners.","contentWithMarkup":"a moment to pause and reflect...<br /><br /><div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-yJZjGtieJkE/WkKF3k0ShgI/AAAAAAAABhU/lYw8PJtNkTclqXCzT51vcbeBMvZGLJPOgCPcBGAYYCw/s1600/FB_IMG_1504466980309.jpg\" imageanchor=\"1\" style=\"margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;\"><img border=\"0\" data-original-height=\"920\" data-original-width=\"1320\" height=\"223\" src=\"https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-yJZjGtieJkE/WkKF3k0ShgI/AAAAAAAABhU/lYw8PJtNkTclqXCzT51vcbeBMvZGLJPOgCPcBGAYYCw/s320/FB_IMG_1504466980309.jpg\" width=\"320\" /></a></div>Moments of gratitude.<br />For a life filled with awesome experiences.<br />For a journey that has had its bumps, twists, and turns.<br />For hugs and laughter shared from sweet friendships along the way.<br />For family who love me unconditionally<br /><a href=\"https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-e7ahpAgab9E/Wlz0oxqwLAI/AAAAAAAABmk/lHIhNLHaXUwZ60kSGXNUk30xbiW_PJ0twCPcBGAYYCw/s1600/119.jpg\" imageanchor=\"1\" style=\"clear: right; float: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 1em;\"><img border=\"0\" data-original-height=\"1067\" data-original-width=\"1600\" height=\"133\" src=\"https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-e7ahpAgab9E/Wlz0oxqwLAI/AAAAAAAABmk/lHIhNLHaXUwZ60kSGXNUk30xbiW_PJ0twCPcBGAYYCw/s200/119.jpg\" width=\"200\" /></a>For a husband who puts up with my antics and loves me through the hiccups, hugs me and says it's going to be alright.<br />The sweet memories of all the adventures this life has given me and the people and friendships forged along its path.<br />For a job that continues to feed my spirit and bring joy to my life and for coworkers who help me, support me, laugh with me, and bring me light.<br /><br />Yes there are moments of sadness today...<br />Waking up and there isn't the first call of the day from her.
