In May, Old Point finished integrating Citizens' banking systems to officially transition customer accounts and services. Shuford said the new sign recently went up, marking Old Point’s first banking acquisition.    As of March 31, the combined company had assets of about $1.04 billion, about $833 million in deposits and capital of about $102 million, according to a news release.    Shuford said while not the goal, crossing the billion-dollar threshold is an exciting milestone. Mostly, Old Point has grown organically by developing relationships across the Peninsula over the years, more so than with acquisitions, he said.

Old Point has been testing the program the past few years.    High-performing workers who are diligent about their education and customer service can move up faster, and potentially into management, Shuford said.    Shuford said the program comes as more college graduates sought entry-level positions after the recession.    “This puts our best and brightest young employees on the right track to earn substantially more money very quickly,” Shuford said.    Jason Kollra, 35, of Hampton has been in banking nearly 10 years — five of those with Old Point. After moving from Pennsylvania, he worked his way up through multiple positions at Old Point from being a teller in downtown Hampton to being promoted to assistant branch manager in New Town about a year ago.    “I remember waving to Jason every day at the teller counter. Now, he’s an assistant branch manager,” Shuford said.    Kollra said he likes the clear-cut planning, goal-setting and the ability to take additional courses.    “It shows they care about us and want to see us grow,” Kollra said.    The personal development along with Old Point’s culture and people enables Kollra to see Old Point as a strong career move. Plus, he said he met fiancee Leslie Eubank while working there. He proposed last week and his colleagues have been congratulating him.    Company-wide, Old Point employs about 300 people, Shuford said, and is advertising at least 11 open positions online.    While many companies have said tax reform is helping them invest in employees, Shuford said it’s more a “happy coincidence” because that was already in the works at Old Point.

Tax reform also provides for a 20 percent deduction for qualified business income from pass-through entities — a potentially large benefit for small businesses.    Old Point Chief Financial Officer Jeffrey Farrar said Old Point already strategized to maximize tax savings and while it may not see immediate benefits from the corporate tax rate cut, the bank can benefit over time as earnings grow.    Still, Old Point can see a secondary benefit sooner as clients of the bank may see immediate benefits and invest in their businesses, Farrar said. Improved federal spending also can help Old Point’s business clients who are involved in government contracting, Shuford added.    Lower individual tax rates can also translate into individuals buying homes, going to college or buying new cars, Shuford said. That could mean more folks taking out loans or responsibly using credit.    “It’s a really exciting time for Old Point,” Shuford said.    Bozick can be reached by phone at 757-247-4741.
