The British actor, 41, is said to have helped the cyclist after he spotted him being beaten up by a gang of four people in central London while riding in a taxi with wife Sophie Hunter in Marylebone High Street.    He then reportedly ran towards them shouting to the attackers \"leave him alone\" after seeing them hit the victim with a bottle, and his quick-thinking actions are believed to have stopped the rider from suffering serious injuries.    \"Deliveroo riders are heroes delivering millions of meals to hungry customers right across the country,\" said a company spokesman.    \"Their safety is our priority and any violence against riders is totally unacceptable. We'd like to thank Benedict Cumberbatch for his heroic actions. On behalf of everyone at Deliveroo: thank you so much.\"    It was claimed that Cumberbatch, who most recently appeared on the big screen in Marvel's Avengers: Infinity War, managed to drag the gang off the victim before they tried to punch Benedict, but he fended them off and they fled.    The assault is said to have happened near Baker Street - the road where the fictional detective Sherlock Holmes lives.    According to The Sun, the TV and film star, who also stars in new Sky Atlantic TV drama Patrick Melrose, said: \"I did it out of, well, I had to, you know.\"    The driver of the car, Manuel Dias, told the newspaper: \"Benedict was courageous, brave and selfless.    \"If he hadn't stepped in, the cyclist could have been seriously injured.\"    He added: \"Here was Sherlock Holmes fighting off four attackers just round the corner from Baker Street.    \"He stood there instructing them in the street, shouting, 'Leave him alone'.    \"I had hold of one lad and Benedict another. He seemed to know exactly what he was doing. He was very brave.    \"He did most of it, to be honest.\"       © Sky News 2","contentWithMarkup":"Deliveroo has thanked Sherlock star Benedict Cumberbatch for his \"heroic actions\" in saving one of its food delivery riders from being attacked by a gang in central London.
