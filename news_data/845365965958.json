It's that time of year again! I was out mowing my property the other day and mowed over poison ivy! Within 2 days I was covered in a rash all over my body. Especially on my throat and chin and so many other places that it spread.  I found an old bar of Poison Ivy Soap and the minute I started using it I could feel cool relief the \"devils itch oil\" being sucked out of my skin. AHHHH! Relief!!!! I used this every 12 hours in a medium warm shower. I turned the water off, vigorously soaped my entire body and then let it stay on my skin for at least 5 minutes. Extra rashy spots got an extra dose! Then I rinsed off with Luke warm water, pat dry and change clothes again. Within 2 DAYS my rash was gone, no blisters or scabs and no SCARS! After my skin started drying out I dabbed it with Neosporin 2 times a day. I took an antihistamine to keep the itch down and what normally would have lasted forever for me was over in about a week. Now I use it every time I shower after I mow or work outside.  *Also works great for bug bite itch for me!!  ** SAFE for EVERYONE! SAFE for PREGNANCY!  I highly recommend this Poison Ivy Soap - It was wonderful for me! You can get on your next Amazon order!! Just click on the link or the pic below to add it to your cart!
