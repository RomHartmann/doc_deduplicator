(WJAC)      ALLEGHENY, Pa. (WJAC) – A Cambria County teenager died after crashing his all-terrain vehicle along the Allegheny Township and Gallitzin Township line, Pennsylvania State Police said.     Police were called at 7 a.m. when a postal worker noticed a body lying in a driveway off Bem Road. The man knocked on the door of the nearby house to call 911.    Police said Cody Maines, 19, of Ashville was southbound on Bem Road when he lost control and rolled his Yamaha Grizzly 550 ATV.    Maines was thrown from the ATV and was lying in a yard, authorities said.    Police said he was not wearing a helmet at the time of the crash and speed and alcohol played a factor.    Cambria County Coroner Jeff Lees pronounced Maines dead at the scene.    Lees said it appears the accident happened sometime after midnight, but Maines wasn’t discovered until Saturday morning.    Maines was a volunteer firefighter with the Ashville Fire Department since he was 14 years old. The department was also dispatched to the scene, along with Loretto Fire Department and Cresson Ambulance.    “It becomes extremely difficult when dealing with one of our own, as a first responder,” Lees said. “Our volunteers are very professional and they handled this situation with the utmost professionalism and courtesy. I’m very proud of our first responders, the way they handled themselves in this difficult situation.”    Lees said Maines was also in the Army, home on leave after completing basic training, spending time with family and close friends.    “This is a heart-wrenching loss for the community,” Lees said. “Summer is upon us and I want to remind individuals the importance of safety and caution when operating these all-terrain vehicles. They can be very dangerous if not used properly.”    Lees ruled the manner of death as accidental and said an autopsy performed Saturday afternoon confirmed Maines died from a head injury.    Toxicology results are pending.    In 2017 there were four ATV accidents. Lees said this is the first of the year.","contentWithMarkup":"A Cambria County teenager died after crashing his all-terrain vehicle along the Allegheny Township and Gallitzin Township line, Pennsylvania State Police said.
