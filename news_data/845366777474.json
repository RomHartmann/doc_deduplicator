The admission process for professional/technical courses go on till September while the NU has made it a must to register by June 20. In the absence of a window for such students, many were unable to get admission after they couldn't land a seat in professional courses last academic year.  Just like 2017, the NU had also not given due publicity to the schedule which left many parents and students in the dark about the admission process for UG courses.   NU officials said such students can fill up forms and confirm admission, if needed, in September when the rounds for competitive exams are over. “It is not possible to have a separate provision for such students,” an official from college section said.   Asked why the university did not publicize this, the official said the news has already been reported by newspapers and there was “no need” for any additional measure.   Some teachers told TOI that those targeting medical or engineering courses generally do not bother to block a seat in non-professional courses until they run out of options. “Ultimately, when they don’t get admission in preferred college or location, students start think of opting for degree courses like BA, BCom or BSc,” a Humanities teacher said.    The teacher added that the common admission process (CAP) rounds drag till September. “By this time seats in all popular colleges are filled up. Besides, the colleges are also not allowed to admit students who didn’t fill up forms in June as per the common schedule,” the teacher said.  Also, parents and teachers get surprised when colleges tell them that the admission for UG courses started in June and direct admissions are not permitted.  Last year, when the common schedule was introduced, the university had to allow a 10% intake hike in colleges to accommodate students who came at the last moment.  Different student organizations, colleges, parents and students had submitted their requests and also staged strong protests at the university main building. Another complain from them was about donations in lieu of seats though colleges had denied the allegations saying there was hardly any scope for taking direct admissions.","contentWithMarkup":"Nagpur: This year too, the Nagpur University (NU) has failed to address concerns of parents and students, who are eyeing professional courses like medical, engineering, pharmacy, in its common admission schedule for UG courses.
