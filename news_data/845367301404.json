{"sequenceId":"845367301404","id":"34207262466","language":"English","title":"A date with the King","content":"The Westin Kolkata Rajarhat organised “Mango Mela” at its all-day dining restaurant, Seasonal Tastes. The event showcased an impressive array of various dishes made with mangoes in addition to their regular buffet.    First up was the “Aam Galli”, which is a separate section of the buffet dedicated to curated mango dishes. A walk through the Mango Galli proved to not only be a treat to the taste-buds but also to the eyes and the nose as the well cut mangoes were especially fresh and ripe and had a heavenly smell that one could not get enough of. The mangoes used by the Westin were Gulabkhas, Dilkhush, Amrapali, Langra, Fazli, Himsagar, Laxmanbhog and Mallika.    Particularly memorable was the Mango Phuchka with potato and mango fillings that was complimented well by the mango flavoured “paani” that came in sweet and sour varieties. The Mango Chaat proved to be a pleasant surprise as was the Mango Lassi and the Kairi ka Jaljeera. Mango sweets were also found in abundance in the dessert section.       The event also had an interesting “Learn the Chef Sutra” challenge in which the chef agreed to teach a customer the recipe of a particular mango dish on the condition that the customer teaches the chef one mango recipe of their own! If the chef liked the recipe, it would be added to their selection of mango dishes and the best one at the end of the event earned the customer a voucher for two.    The venue gives off a premium vibe with good ambience, lighting, music and service. The buffet was unquestionably a must try for all mango lovers","contentWithMarkup":"The Westin Kolkata Rajarhat organised “Mango Mela” at its all-day dining restaurant, Seasonal Tastes.
