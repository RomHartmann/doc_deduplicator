De Palma also says that in the #MeToo era, women will acquire more film-industry power and possibly change our cinematic landscape. \"It will be interesting to see when women start controlling the aesthetic, what is going to happen,\" he says. \"It would be interesting to see if their gaze is so much different than ours.
