Birchett Brown was born on November 7, 1917, in Clinton, North Carolina. She was the third of four children born to the late Sallie Birchett Jackson and Willie Birchett.    At the age of 6, Lillian’s family moved to Lawrenceville, VA., where she attended St. Paul’s Normal & Industrial School (St. Paul’s College). At 16, Lillian moved to Petersburg, VA., and by the age of 18, relocated to New Haven. Prior to the start of her 37-year career at Winchester Repeating Arms in 1982, where Lillian also served as a Shop Steward, she married New Haven native Francis W. Brown in 1941. By 1953, the couple were one of the first Black families to have purchased a home in the Newhallville section of the city.    For several years, Lillian’s Newhallville home became the site of the Democratic Headquarters. During this time, she was active in the community and subsequently served for 10 years on the Democratic Town Committee. In 1973, Lillian was also elected the last City Treasurer under the Administration of Mayor Bart Guida, and served on several boards and commissions including: the United Newhallville Organization; Newhallville Restoration Corporation; State Women’s Democratic Federation; the Black Elected Officials; the League of Women Voters; New Haven Federation of Democats; and the City of New Haven Housing & Development Board under the Administration of Mayor Biagio Dilieto. Additionally, she was a Founder and Chairwoman of the Women’s Democratic Caucus. Acknowledgement of Lillian’s latter contributions have been recognized by the United Newhallville Organization, the New Haven Women’s Democratic Club, and Community Baptist Church (where she was an active member for 60 years and served on the Board of Trustees).    Throughout Lillian’s years, she was highly regarded as a pillar of strength in the Newhallville community. Many people have sought her advice and wisdom, from community activists to people wishing to seek office. For some, Lillian, affectionately known as Mama, will be remembered for the clothes that she made her four daughters, especially at Easter. To others, she will be remembered for the gorgeous flowers that she grew around her home, and yet others will miss her sitting on her front porch watching the world go by! But most would concede that Lillian’s greatest accomplishment was raising her four daughters as a single parent.    Lillian leaves to mourn her son, Thomas D. Brown of Wallingford; her daughters, Lilian Cowan of Hamden; Sally J. Brown of New Haven; and Diane X Brown of Hamden; 7 grandchildren; 11 great-grandchildren; and 4 great-great grandchildren. Lillian was preceded in death by her son, Frank A. Brown; daughter, Carol A. Brown-McLaughlin; granddaughter, Stephanie Brown-Singley; sisters, Hettie Birchett and Nellie Byrd; and her brother, Thomas Birchett.    The family would also like to extend a “Special Thank You” to all the nurses, doctors and staff at the Hamden Rehabilitation & Health Care Center, 1270 Sherman Lane, Hamden, and Connecticut Hospice for all the excellent comfort and care given not only to Lillian, but to their entire family. A Celebration of Lillian’s Life will be held on Tuesday, June 5, at Community Baptist Church, 143 Shelton Ave., New Haven. (Viewing hours are from 4-6 p.m. and the service will begin at 6 p.m.). Interment will follow on Wednesday, June 6, at 10a.m. in Beaverdale Memorial Park, Hamden.
