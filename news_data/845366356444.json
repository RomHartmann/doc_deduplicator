The Anniston man said he’d heard of the church’s medical clinic and the free care it provides to many in the community.      “I’d just heard about how much good they do for people who can’t afford to get a doctor,” Smith said.      Smith was one of the many people who attended the church’s annual BBQ and Bluegrass Benefit, held to raise money for the St. Michael’s Clinic. All proceeds from the event support the clinic, which provides health care to the uninsured in Calhoun County.      Visitors could either donate money directly to the clinic or purchase $10 plates of barbecue to eat while being serenaded by different bands. The event also had several corporate sponsors to help support the clinic.      Brenda Jones of Anniston said Saturday was her second year to attend the fundraiser.        Close            Foggy Hollow Review plays a tune for the crowd.

Dr. Nanette Mudiam, executive director of the clinic, said Saturday afternoon that so far, attendance to the fundraiser had been strong thanks to good weather.      Mudiam said the clinic is supported entirely by donations and grants. Demand for the clinic is strong and steady, she said.      “There is a far greater need than we can meet,” Mudiam said. “We would be open more if we could afford it.”      Currently, the clinic is open every Wednesday and Thursday, plus every first Friday of the month.         According to St. Michael’s, the clinic, open since 1988, had 2,083 patient sign-ins last year, an average of 22 patients daily.      Mudiam said clinic patients range between 18 and 64 years old and are treated for a gamut of issues.      “We see all kinds of things, but the main things we treat are diabetes and hypertension … we see a lot of that,” she said.      Denise Dodd of Wellborn has attended the church for 65 years and is quite familiar with the clinic.      “That clinic I think is a godsend to the people who live around here,” Dodd said as she enjoyed some barbecue. “A lot of them would never get into a doctor’s office otherwise … and the people who work there are wonderful.”","contentWithMarkup":"Ronnie Smith isn’t a member of the Church of St. Michael and All Angels in Anniston, but he stopped by Saturday to support it anyway.
