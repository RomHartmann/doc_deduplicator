I used to look forward to it. Now, it just fills me with dread and disappointment. Yeah, that’s right. I’ll be turning 29 again soon…. in 9 days… on the 11th. What? You want to get me a gift? I will be happy to accept. I wouldn’t want to hurt your feelings. But it’s so hard for me to come up with suggestions. Just send money. Or buy me coffee. In truth, it is a crappy day for me. I don’t want to age anymore. So while I don’t want it to be a huge celebration, I don’t want it to be (mostly) forgotten or ignored either. But that’s what tends to happen. I usually bake my own cake. Maybe get some take-out so I don’t have to cook. My daughter will make me a card… she always comes through on that. And that will be it. I guess it’s fine… maybe it’ll kind of erase the aging part. Oh please… no it won’t. Sigh. I will try not to slip in to a depressive state over this, but honestly, no one would even notice as I’m already in that state. I need to get to a different state. Like Hawaii. Who knows? Maybe it’ll be better this year. I’ll keep you posted.   ©2018 what sandra thinks           Advertisements","contentWithMarkup":"I can’t remember when the tides turned. It used to be fun.
