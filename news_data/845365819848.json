Amazing.     A generation of young people today feel the American taxpayers payers should bail them out.  I went through San Diego State University back in the 70's and paid my own way through college; my generation thought that way.  I worked \"four ten's\" a week as a jet engine mechanic and each afternoon would race to school and attend classes until late at night.  I would then go home and try to spend some time studying before hitting the sac, only to get up at 6:30 a.m. the next morning to begin the same routine again. On my three day weekends off, I would sit on my patio and study all day while watching my wife tend to and enjoy time with the kids that I couldn't.  That's right, I had three kids and a wife to support while going to college and working full time.     I didn't go into debt to attend classes, I worked for my education. My generation did it that way back then, for the most part.  Today we are raising generations of kids that live by another code, \"just charge it please\".  We all know that they are their own worst enemy because of what they see as \"free money\" at the time.    Many spend their time at these parasitic colleges and universities getting a degree in some worthless pursuit that will never reward them with a \"good job\" or career.  These shameless institutes of \"higher learning\" know they can keep raising fees and tuition on these young wide-eyed kids because the bill is \"on the tab\".  They remind me of the frog sitting in the boiling pot.     Educators won't \"pay the Piper\", these young people will, later, much later.  Many will find the good times at college produced a degree that is worthless in today's high tech environment. The professors won't care, they're on to their next class of gullible kids.     \"Man up\" and grow up.  Nothing in life is free, and maybe it's time you learned those hard facts.     Bill Reesor     * * *     I agree.  I managed to go through school without racking up debt. I encourage everyone to enjoy the education system USA has to offer and the challenge to complete any degree encourages one to have creative thoughts, to work with others, to think of solutions for world issues, and to think in general.  Pursuing advanced degrees is probably the last time young adults are afforded the opportunity to shed life’s responsibilities and mentally expand free from the pressures of family.     However, I do subscribe to the notion that “ain’t nothing free”.  Perhaps these loan payoffs should come with the responsibility to payback with their time and efforts.  Such as, doctors provide services to those in need, or lawyers complete a number of hours of free services, or engineers work on public housing or road projects or foreign projects, etc. Work is the great leveler. When a person has a job to provide his or her family with basic needs, there is a sense of accomplishment and pride that comes with earning something. Also, as young adults enter the job market, such repayment might be a way for them to start meaningful jobs.     A loan-to-work concept is not new, my father participate in the pre-WWII Civilian Conservation Corps and I grew in the era of the Peace Core and other New Deal efforts. What a better way to break that cycle piling up debts than to work yourself out of debt.     Stan Moses  Chattanooga Native  Former paper boy","contentWithMarkup":"The internet has an article today stating that Congress will allocate $350 million to help students pay off their student loans.
