Galvin acknowledged he has a fight on his hands in the September primary.    In the race for governor, delegates on Saturday tapped Jay Gonzalez over Bob Massie as their choice to try to unseat Republican Gov. Charlie Baker.    And in the race for lieutenant governor, delegates backed former White House policy adviser Quentin Palfrey over comic Jimmy Tingle.    All six candidates won enough support to appear on the September primary.    Candidates needed the backing of more than half of delegates to win the party’s endorsement and 15 percent to secure a space on the primary ballot.","contentWithMarkup":"WORCESTER — Massachusetts Democratic Party delegates have gathered in Worcester for the party’s annual convention and in a surprise move endorsed challenger Boston city councilor Josh Zakim for secretary of state over long-time incumbent William Galvin.
