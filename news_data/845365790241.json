Specifically, developer Steve Troughton-Smith tweeted some screenshots this morning of what he said was macOS 10.14. And while the screenshots focused on Xcode 10, they also revealed a couple of bigger changes to the operating system.    For one thing, it looks like the new version of macOS will include a more comprehensive dark mode — one that doesn’t just darken the menu bar and the dock, but applies much more broadly, affecting apps and even the Trash can . The screenshots also include an icon for Apple News in the dock, so there’s probably a new desktop version of the app on the way.     Ladies and gentlemen, I give you Xcode 10 on macOS 10.14.

He said Apple posted a preview video for Xcode to the Mac App Store API — a video he then shared with 9to5Mac . So it seems the Mac App Store will start include preview videos like this one (the iOS App Store already does).    Ahead of WWDC, there have been rumors that Apple will launch “universal” apps that work on both desktop and mobile. Nothing here confirms that, but it does suggest Apple is working to make iOS and macOS — and their respective App Stores — more similar.
