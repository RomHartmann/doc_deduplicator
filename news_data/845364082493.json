(Photo: Cheri Carlson/The Star) Buy Photo      Reflecting the city’s limited water supply, coupled with the ongoing drought, Ventura should continue to stay in a Stage 3 Water Shortage Event.     That’s the recommendation Ventura Water General Manager Kevin Brown will make to the City Council on Monday night. If they approve it, elected officials will be confirming that the city’s water supply remains well below what used to be considered normal or typical conditions.    Ventura has been in Stage 3 since September 2014, when the council called for a mandatory 20 percent reduction in water use. To be in the stage, the city must be between 20 percent and 29 percent below “normal year supply projection,” according to the 2018 Comprehensive Water Resources Report.     See the full report here .     The city’s 2018 supply is projected at 15,321 acre-feet, roughly 22 percent lower than during a normal year, the report says. Should the drought continue, the city’s water supply will be less than the demand for it in upcoming years. That imbalance should return to the supply side once the city connects to state water, figures show.    The outlook last year:  Ventura’s water supply still strained, officials say    The report is released annually to give planning officials information on how best to manage supplies and at what pace development can be sustained. It looks at its water sources, which include Lake Casitas, groundwater, the Ventura River and a small amount of recycled water.     Also Monday, the council will vote on directing the county’s tax collector’s office to place a lien on 17 parcels in the city for failing to pay civil penalties related to the condition of their property.    Several owners have multiple violations, including Dario Pini, who owns dozens of properties in Ventura and Santa Barbara counties. Pini owes just shy of $8,600 for five citations on two Pierpont residences; the violations are listed as “substandard housing” in the city’s staff report.

More than two years ago, the city cited the new owners of the historic hotel for doing extensive, unpermitted work and the owners apparently have yet to address it. Patel owes $66,000, the staff report noted.    Two years and going:  Ventura’s Pierpont Inn flagged for more violations    DKN Hotels announced it had bought the historic Pierpont Inn in early 2015. The city red-tagged parts of the inn in January 2016 after officials found the company had gutted gutting the lobby, restaurant and bar, and made electrical and mechanical changes. The unauthorized work extended to guest rooms.     In total, there are 39 violations citywide. “The total value of delinquent properties as of May 30, 2018 is $101,576.50,” the report says. The property owners were given numerous opportunities to respond, the report notes. Once the paperwork is completed, a parcel tax lien will be placed on the property.     In other business, the city will vote on extending its lease with the owners of Cafe Fiore. The lease began in 2003 and at the time, the city charged 21 cents per square foot. The new lease, effective July 1 to June 30, 2023, would gradually increase those costs from $1.32 per square foot initially to $1.43 per square foot by the final year.     Cafe Fiore uses the 2,160-square-foot city-owned property for its outdoor patio. For the five-year period, the city will get $175,219 in revenue. The Italian restaurant is at 66 California St.    Before the meeting, the council will meet in closed session to discuss new contracts with several employee groups as well as the city manager position. The council has held several meetings on the executive post, including a special one called last week.     City Manager Mark Watkins retired in December, and assistant City Manager Dan Paranick has been serving in the post since then. Mayor Neal Andrews said recently that the council previously offered the position to an out-of-state candidate who ended up declining after the Thomas Fire.    Monday’s meeting will start at 6 p.m. at City Hall, 501 Poli St. Because it is the first meeting of the month, public comment on any item not on the agenda will start things off.
