{"sequenceId":"845361935508","id":"34207102565","language":"English","title":"Release Blitz: Fight [Fate 01] by Paige Hill!","content":"Fate has kicked my ass from day one. My name is Teagan Langford and I grew up in the system. Just another child neglect case, crossing a cluttered desk. For a small window of time, I thought fate had taken mercy on me when the future District Attorney swept me off my feet. From the outside looking in, we have the perfect life. The reality however, is my personal nightmare. One violent night, fate forces me to make a choice and I must run to survive. With no money, food or place to live, I search for work where cash is king, and questions won’t be asked. Once again, fate drops me in the hands of a handsome bartender who wants to help me. But everyone has secrets. Ones that have the potential to destroy everything. A fugitive on the run, one determined stalker, an undercover agent and a high-profile family with a lot to lose. Suddenly, I find myself fighting for life, love and freedom. Check it out on Goodreads! Buy your copy from Amazon Author bio: Paige typically spends her days surviving on copious amounts of coffee and fantasizing about the day she becomes a full-time writer. Because even Batman needs a day job, her morning hours are spent buying drugs (the legal kind), as a pharmacy purchasing coordinator for a growing health system. When she isn’t buying drugs, she’s dreaming up hot alphas and the strong women that test them. Paige lives in eastern Oklahoma with her husband, daughter and two furry body pillows known as “dogs”.  Fun Fact: She is the pickiest eater you will ever meet and a firm believer that the real food groups are coffee, wine and Mexican food.
