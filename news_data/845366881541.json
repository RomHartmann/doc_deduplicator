SAN ANTONIO - A Brandeis High School junior is making news after he got a perfect score on his SAT.    A few weeks after taking the test, Matthew Su checked the score on his phone and saw 800 for both sections. He couldn't believe it.    \"I honestly didn't feel that good about it,\" Su said. \"I never really feel good about any test that I take, mainly because I'm really nervous both before and after. I really didn't have any idea that I would get the score that I got.\"    Su says he's always been an avid reader and also competes academically, which is what he thinks helped him most. He still has a year left in high school, but he does have his eyes set on an Ivy League school.    Su wants to major in environmental science or chemistry.","contentWithMarkup":"Matthew Su, a junior at Brandeis High School, still can't believe he got a perfect score on his SAT.
