{"sequenceId":"845362120870","id":"34207108640","language":"English","title":"A’s comeback bid falls short in loss to Royals","content":"The A’s climbed out of an early hole to come back and tie the game, but a rare mistake from one of their top relievers ended up the toughest blow.    Yusmeiro Petit, who has been one of the A’s more reliable relievers, surrendered a go-ahead solo home run to Jorge Soler in the eighth, which proved to be the difference-maker in Saturday’s 5-4 loss to the Royals.    Trevor Cahill appeared ticketed for a short outing after allowing four runs through his first two innings of work, even causing manager Bob Melvin to get Danny Coulombe to start warming up in the bullpen after allowing two runs in the second. But the right-hander seemed to settle in after the shaky start.    Though he did not complete five innings for the first time this season and allowed a season-high four runs on seven hits and two walks with six strikeouts over just 4 2/3 innings, Cahill kept the A’s in the game and enabled them to chip away at the early four-run deficit.    After Bruce Maxwell mashed his first home run of the season, a solo shot to center field in the seventh that cut the deficit to 4-3, Chad Pinder tied the game in the top of the eighth with a pinch hit single to center that brought home Matt Olson.","contentWithMarkup":"The A’s climbed out of an early hole to come back and tie the game, but a rare mistake from one of their top relievers ended up the toughest blow.
