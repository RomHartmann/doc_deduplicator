Let friends in your social network know what you are reading about    Johnson's decision not to run for re-election raises questions of Council's regard for the law   All Johnson wanted was for our community to be in compliance with the Refugee Act of 1980, 8 USC 1522.

He is tired of the name calling.     I am not opposed to immigration and refugees; after all, my grandparents came from Germany and Norway.     All Johnson wanted was for our community to be in compliance with the Refugee Act of 1980, 8 USC 1522. It is the law — and the city probably is not in compliance.    What other laws would the citizens like to see violated?     I know, we'll let the police enter anyone's home any time and search just for the fun of it! Let's have county human services publish in the Times the name and financial data of everyone who applies for services! We'll also have the county publish in the Times the name, address and photo of every juvenile accused of anything! The council should instruct the police to stop doing age checks on liquor stores and tobacco sales. The council should instruct the police to issue Permits to Carry to all felons.     I like that — if you don't like the law, just ignore it. After all, the City Council is leading by example!     Read or Share this story: https://on.sctimes.com/2JayATn     From The USA TODAY NETWORK    These sites are part of the USA TODAY NETWORK.
