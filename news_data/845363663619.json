Frustrated because she says no one is doing anything about it, she reached out to us hoping for help.    Alyssa Williams says her son Mason, in kindergarten, is being bullied.    \"They are not nice. They are being mean,” Mason said.    \"I feel so helpless, because I've been trying everything I can. I'm at the point where I want to move because I feel like that's the only thing I can do,” Williams said.    Mason has a speech impairment, but Williams believes he may be developmentally delayed.    \"If you speak to him, you can obviously see, or spend a day with him, you can see there's more than that,” Williams said.    She also believes that's the reason some kids at Old Forge Elementary School are targeting him.    She says Mason has dealt with bullies before, but the worst alleged incident happened just two weeks ago.    \"...punched me in the eye,” Mason said.    Williams says Mason came home with a swollen eye after a kid allegedly hit him on the bus ride home.    \"The bus driver that day just said, \"he just got punched in the face.\" That's all he did,” she said.    Frustrated and sad, she wrote a letter to the school, but says no one returned her letters or calls.    \"I've reached out to the school about him being punched in the face. I called, left messages, I wrote letters, I still haven't received any response whatsoever,” she said.    Mason's mom wants to see bus surveillance camera footage, but she had a difficult time getting it from a school administrator after a previous incident two months ago.    \"When I asked for footage, she just said the cameras are acting up and they're not working,” she said.    But when we spoke to the bus company earlier today, they told us there are working cameras on every bus.    Williams is afraid of retaliation now that she's spoken up about what's going on, but believes it's the right thing to do.    \"Nothing's been done. I don't know one child who's been punished, detention, nothing,” Williams added.    The school district had no comment on the issue.    Meanwhile, the bus company tells us they don't have anything on file about that particular incident on the bus.    However, a representative says she’ll look into it as soon as Williams gives her a call.","contentWithMarkup":"OLD FORGE, LACKAWANNA COUNTY (WOLF-TV) —   A mother in Old Forge says a student on her son's bus punched him in the face, giving him a black eye.
