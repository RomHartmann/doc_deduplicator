I was excited because I had never seen this part of Oregon before. It didn’t disappoint it was a beautiful area with tons of trees and mountains. Our first day we went to the tournament and watched Tyler. Jaelee and Jayse were able to play with their cousins and of course electronics (need to start banning those things!) during the tournament and that night swim at the hotel pool. The next day we went to Medford to a family fun center. It was the first time the kids were tall enough to drive their own go carts. This would be there favorite thing the entire trip! After the fun center we went back to watch Tyler some more. When the tournament was over we got a quick bite to eat and headed back to Reedsport. On our way home we stopped at the sign in Scottsburg that talks about Levi Scott. We told Jayse that’s where his middle name Levi came from and he told his class about it. LaRee had told me about this sign so we had to stop and get a picture.
