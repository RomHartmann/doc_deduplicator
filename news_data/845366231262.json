Crews from across the region and all New England have spent weeks gathering debris and repairing utilities, yet Steinberg’s northern Danbury neighborhood looks much as it did in the days after the storm that killed two and caused at least $18 million in damage across the area.    Dead power lines and broken branches are still strewn across the road. A chorus of wood chippers roars most of every day. Some stretches of road are open to only one car at a time. School buses are still prohibited from picking up students until utility companies untangle downed wires now mixed into the brush.    The glacial pace of the cleanup has frustrated neighbors and city officials alike.    Steinberg argues that the response from the city and utilities lagged right after the storm, leaving the neighbors to dig themselves out.    “I feel so badly for the kid that did die and the woman in New Fairfield,” Steinberg said. “When those kinds of traumas happen, we all personalize them. We all make them ours.    “That’s why it was so upsetting with the city’s response being so cold initially, rather than saying let’s get together and make this happen,” he said. “That didn’t happen.”    But city officials counter that the scale of damage was unprecedented.    Paul Estefan, Danbury’s director of civil preparedness, said the damage on Forty Acre Mountain was “unbelievable.” He has been working directly with neighbors in that area and shares their frustrations as cleanup slowly continues.    “There’s a car demolished still in the road, glass all over the place,” he said. “The road’s got to be swept, cleaned. Wires from Eversource have to be picked up and transformers. You can’t run a school bus and compromise the safety of the students. These are some of the pitfalls we’re running into.”    The city’s claw truck spent the end of the week hauling away debris, but the downed and dead wires often mixed with them are complicating and slowing the process, Estefan said.    Eversource still needs to pick up some lines, poles and transformers but won’t pick up equipment belonging to cable and internet providers, Estefan said. The city is still trying to track down cable crews, just like residents still trying to get their own services restored.    The cleanup expected to take all summer to finish.    In the northern corner of Danbury, officials estimate the damage will cost almost $4.8 million to repair. That includes $464,000 in damage to homes and $534,000 in damage to businesses, Estefan said.    But the bulk of the bill will be about $3.7 million for roads and public right-of-way, like that on Forty Acre Mountain Road, he said. Crews are charting places where the road must be torn out and replaced because asphalt “turned to glass, basically” when power lines fell on it.    In New Fairfield and Brookfield, where 110-mph winds from what meteorologists call a “macroburst” tore through the area, the damage is more widespread.    “It’s an incredibly daunting task,” said Maria Evans, New Fairfield’s director of emergency management. “It’s not like it was just one area of town; it was all over, which makes it so much more difficult to do.”    About $1.8 million in damage was done to the town’s roads and public areas, but officials estimate the storm caused more than $7.6 million in damage to more than 200 homes — including 13 completely destroyed and another 24 rendered uninhabitable, First Selectman Pat Del Monaco said.    Brookfield officials called the storms the “worst natural disaster in Brookfield history.” They estimated damage at almost $3.8 million, but that number doesn’t include the 75 boats and cars destroyed or almost 550 homes damaged.    In the first three hours after the storm, Brookfield Police received 339 calls to 911, said Greg Dembowski, the town’s FEMA coordinator. Police, public works crews and 68 firefighters, paramedics and dispatchers logged almost 7,000 total work hours from May 15 to May 25 —not counting the hundreds of resident volunteers who helped, he noted.    Preliminary damage reports from municipalities across the state are now under review by the Division of Emergency Management and Homeland Security. The division has not released an overall state estimate while it determines eligibility of the cost reports for federal aid.    Once the statewide assessment is finalized, Gov. Dannel P. Malloy is expected to send the application for aid to the Federal Emergency Management Agency and ultimately to the president for approval.    Only then will local officials have a better idea of what types and amounts of reimbursement their cities and towns might receive, if any, and potentially get to hire crews for the remaining cleanup work. That work must be done by approved contractors and monitored closely to ensure that a litany of regulations are followed and that FEMA does not eventually disallow costs deemed ineligible, potentially slowing some of the work, officials cautioned.    The Steinbergs are just happy work that is underway in their area, even if it is later than they wanted.    They’re now working through the insurance claims process on the $60,000 to $80,000 in damage to their property, Steinberg said. They count themselves lucky they are saddled pnly with property damage and not with serious injuries to themselves.    “The big oak tree that fell will give me enough firewood for the next few winters,” he said with a laugh. “You got to look at the bright side: I don’t have to buy firewood for awhile.”    zach.murdock@hearstmediact.com","contentWithMarkup":"Photo: H John Voorhees III / Hearst Connecticut Media      Image 1 of / 17      Caption    Close         Image  1  of  17     George Bailey looks over the remaining storm damage trees on his Pocono Point Road property, on Thursday, May 31, 2018, in Danbury, Conn.
