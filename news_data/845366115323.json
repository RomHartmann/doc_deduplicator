Take time out for a safari to view some of the continent’s iconic residents.  You will summit the 5,896-metre Uhuru Peak from the Rongai Route where you can expect a fairly tough, steep trek walking through forest where you’re likely to catch a glimpse of the Kilimanjaro colobus monkeys. There are plenty of acclimatisation stops along the way, most notably at the Second Cave, at 3,450m, with superb views of Kibo, and Mawenzi Tarn, at 4,330m, situated in a cirque beneath the spires of Mawenzi.    The sight of the permanently snow-capped peak of Mount Kilimanjaro provides a constant source of inspiration when viewed from the vast plains. It is also a natural focus for any fit trekker keen to summit the highest peak in Africa. The Rongai Route begins in attractive farmland and delightful forest, and passes through several different climate zones, adding considerably to the interest of the trek while at the same time ensuring maximum acclimatisation. This route retains a sense of unspoilt wilderness and offers a different perspective on Kilimanjaro by approaching it from the north. From the alluring summit of Uhuru Peak (5,895m), you will have amazing 360-degree views of the surrounding plains.         Take time out at the end of your trek for a once-in-a-lifetime safari to see some of Africa’s most iconic wildlife or take a short flight across to the stunning island of Zanzibar for some serious beach time.  www.humacharitychallenge.com    ICELAND  The stunning MoonWalk Iceland 2019, taking place in June, is the chance to join women from across the world raising cash for breast cancer.    Imagine spectacular scenery, crater-like landscapes, phenomenal steaming hot lava geysers and fascinating boiling mud pools.    Amongst the breathtaking scenery you will take part in a Summer Solstice Marathon, in the Northern Hemisphere. You will power walk in the land of the midnight sun, a beautiful wilderness where the sun doesn’t set, walking past the mirror-like reflections of the surrounding lakeside and craggy mountains, with only your fellow walkers and new-found friends plus the odd Icelandic horse and sheep for company.    The time allocated for the actual walk is 10 hours, but this is a 14-day trip during which you’ll head to the Reykjanes Peninsula and a visit to the Bridge Between Two Continents, where you’ll cross between the North American and the Eurasian plates.    This part of Iceland combines natural phenomena and geothermal activity and you’ll learn all about its history and mythical stories. Then it’s onwards to the north-east of the country to the stunning area of Lake Myvatn where you’ll explore and set sail, as you head off whale watching, visiting the most powerful waterfall in Europe, climbing a volcano and trekking through lava fields, and of course visiting the local nature baths.    Then there’s a day to explore the Icelandic capital Reykjavik before heading home.  www.walkthewalk.org    COSTA RICA  Cycle Costa Rica 2019 is an amazing 36-km, coast-to-coast cycling challenge raising funds for women’s health organisations. It starts in Limon on the eastern Caribbean coast and finishes in the beautiful Playa Hermosa on the western Pacific coast. Along the way, you’ll experience breathtaking scenery, exotic Caribbean culture and abundant local wildlife.     You can look forward to a journey full of fun, friendship and incredible support as women of all ages and from all walks of life challenge themselves for an amazing cause. It’s a great reason to get fit with the experience of a lifetime as your goal.    It’s a 10-day challenge and, of course, as well as all the fab sights you’ll see along the way, you could tack some extra days on at the end for some well-deserved R&R and a spot of classic tourism such as a visit to the Miravelles hot springs and mud bath, scuba diving or a zip line canopy trip over the rain forest.    Funds raised by Women V Cancer are divided equally between three important UK charities: Breast Cancer Care, Jo’s Cervical Cancer Trust and Ovarian Cancer Action.    www.dream-challenges.com   Post Views","contentWithMarkup":"TANZANIA  The 2019 Tanzania Climb Kilimanjaro Open Challenge, running in June and October, gives the opportunity to raise funds for dozens of Australian-based charities from UNHCR to Save the Bears.
