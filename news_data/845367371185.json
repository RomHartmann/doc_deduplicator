A light was on and the door had been forced open, so the officer entered. There he found three burglars with their loot: $120 worth of cigars. One of the burglars, a 19-year-old named James Farrell (sometimes referred to as George Flint), attempted to escape. As he rushed past McDowell, the policeman struck him with his club. The burglar drew a revolver and fired, the bullet hitting McDowell behind his left ear and passing out his right temple. While the other burglars escaped, the seriously wounded officer managed to wrestle Farrell to the ground, at which point a number of other officers came upon the scene and arrested the burglar. The heroic police officer eventually recovered from his wounds and was given $1,000 for his bravery by the Trustees of the Riot Relief Fund. Additionally, McDowell was awarded the New York City Police Department Medal of Valor.","contentWithMarkup":"<div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\"></div><div style=\"margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;\"><span style=\"text-align: start;\">Who Knew this piece of NYC trivia?</span></div><div style=\"margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;\"><br /></div><div style=\"margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;\"><img alt=\"Image\" height=\"286\" src=\"https://apis.mail.yahoo.com/ws/v3/mailboxes/@.id==VjN-PXpYiPVq1fQqkbgshwdHjZC562WxFIgu3ZPjEdZt7ch900hR20-ChQMLj4klxC1dUWhjIv2uHVC2R0Wv8Q9VgQ/messages/@.id==ABGleHxEAKV4WxGBnACkEIEYu48/content/parts/@.id==4/thumbnail?appId=YMailNorrin&downloadWhenThumbnailFails=true&pid=4\" width=\"320\" /></div><br /><br /> <br /><div class=\"yiv9959235657x_ydpc91743b7yiv8731733542WordSection1\"><div id=\"yiv9959235657x_ydpc91743b7yiv8731733542m_3286938378857220989m_1704673754679183455AOLMsgPart_1.2.1_65688418-3976-42be-8420-475c37d11a7a\"><div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\"></div><div style=\"margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;\"><br /></div><br /><div id=\"yiv9959235657x_ydpc91743b7yiv8731733542m_3286938378857220989m_1704673754679183455aolmail_AOLMsgPart_1.2_6765b9d6-fab9-4830-adc7-8c67224083fc\"><blockquote style=\"margin-bottom: 5pt; margin-top: 5pt;\"><blockquote style=\"margin-bottom: 5pt; margin-top: 5pt;\"><blockquote style=\"margin-bottom: 5pt; margin-top: 5pt;\"><div><div class=\"yiv9959235657x_ydpc91743b7yiv8731733542MsoNormal\" style=\"margin-bottom: 12pt;\"><span style=\"font-size: 11pt;\"></span></div></div><div><div class=\"yiv9959235657x_ydpc91743b7yiv8731733542MsoNormal\" style=\"margin-bottom: 12pt;\"><div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\"><span style=\"clear: right; float: right; font-size: 11pt; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 1em;\"></span></div></div></div><div><div class=\"yiv9959235657x_ydpc91743b7yiv8731733542MsoNormal\"><span style=\"font-size: 11pt;\"></span></div></div><div><div class=\"yiv9959235657x_ydpc91743b7yiv8731733542MsoNormal\"><a href=\"https://apis.mail.yahoo.com/ws/v3/mailboxes/@.id==VjN-PXpYiPVq1fQqkbgshwdHjZC562WxFIgu3ZPjEdZt7ch900hR20-ChQMLj4klxC1dUWhjIv2uHVC2R0Wv8Q9VgQ/messages/@.id==ABGleHxEAKV4WxGBnACkEIEYu48/content/parts/@.id==3/thumbnail?appId=YMailNorrin&downloadWhenThumbnailFails=true&pid=3\" imageanchor=\"1\" style=\"clear: right; float: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 1em;\"><img alt=\"Image\" border=\"0\" height=\"320\" src=\"https://apis.mail.yahoo.com/ws/v3/mailboxes/@.id==VjN-PXpYiPVq1fQqkbgshwdHjZC562WxFIgu3ZPjEdZt7ch900hR20-ChQMLj4klxC1dUWhjIv2uHVC2R0Wv8Q9VgQ/messages/@.id==ABGleHxEAKV4WxGBnACkEIEYu48/content/parts/@.id==3/thumbnail?appId=YMailNorrin&downloadWhenThumbnailFails=true&pid=3\" width=\"196\" /></a><i><span style=\"font-size: 11pt;\">3 o'clock in the morning on January 8, 1877, Officer John McDowell was walking down Seventh Avenue when he noticed something amiss at Courtney's Liquor Store.
