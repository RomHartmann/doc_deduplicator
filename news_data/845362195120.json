{"sequenceId":"845362195120","id":"34207111069","language":"English","title":"Parade of 53-54 Parkhurst Day 2 - Jimmy Thomson","content":"Day two and the parade continues! This time we have a stop in Toronto with card number 8 which features NHL legend and player's advocate Jimmy Thomson. 53-54 Parkhurst Jimmy Thomson I really like this card for a few reasons. First off like his rookie card, it clearly demonstrates an action photo which was translated into a piece of art. Second of all, look at his face, the detail and concentration also indicate this isn't just a posed shot.  Another thing I love about this card is the write-up on the back. Just take a moment to read through it! I am sure the same thing popped out to you as it did me. In all just a pretty cool piece of NHL cardboard. Jimmy was an excellent and reliable NHL player who spent 13 seasons in the NHL and from the sounds of things could have played longer if not for some issues with Conn Smythe and Jimmy's desire to start a player's union. During his playing career Jimmy would win the Memorial Cup and 4 Stanley Cups. In addition to these team accomplishments, he would also be named to the NHL second all-star team twice. Sadly Jimmy did pass away back in 1991 but his legacy in the NHLPA will live on in his honour.","contentWithMarkup":"<div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: left;\">Day two and the parade continues!
