The occupants of the second vehicle, not pictured, were killed. Messenger photo by Joe Duty    Two wrecks within an hour and a couple of miles of each other Thursday evening killed two people and sent another seven to area hospitals.    Texas Department of Public Safety spokesman Lonny Haschel said the first wreck happened around 7:45 p.m. on Texas 114 just east of the Bridgeport city limits. Preliminary information indicates a Chevrolet pickup was traveling west on Texas 114 when the pickup crossed into the eastbound lanes and struck an eastbound Dodge pickup.    The driver and passenger in the Chevrolet, who have not yet been publicly identified, died at the scene.    The driver of the Dodge was transported to Wise Health System in Decatur with unknown injuries.    Investigators are still trying to determine why the driver crossed over into the other lane of traffic.    CHILDREN INJURED – Medics and firefighters treat five children injured in a multiple-vehicle crash between Paradise and Bridgeport Thursday. The wreck happened less than an hour after a fatal wreck less than two miles away on the same road. Messenger photo by Joe Duty    The second crash happened on Texas 114 near County Road 3332 around 8:30 p.m.    Traffic was stopped due to the nearby fatal crash. The driver of a westbound passenger car apparently did not see the stopped traffic and struck a Honda SUV which in turn hit a Chevrolet HHR. The driver of the passenger car sustained minor injuries.    Five children of various ages in the passenger car were injured in the collision. One was flown to Cook Children’s Medical Center in Fort Worth with serious injuries, and a second was taken to the same hospital by ground ambulance with serious injuries. The three remaining children were taken to Wise Health System with unknown injuries.    The driver of the Honda sustained minor injuries, and the driver of the Chevrolet was transported to Wise Health System with unknown injuries.    Both crashes are under investigation.","contentWithMarkup":"<div style=\"width: 590px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img style=\"border: 0px none;\" title=\"Fatality-Wreck.jpg\" alt=\"Fatality Wreck\" src=\"http://www.wcmessenger.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Fatality-Wreck.jpg\" width=\"580\" height=\"298\" border=\"0\" /><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">FATALITY WRECK – A DPS trooper looks over one of the two pickup trucks involved in a wreck near Bridgeport Thursday.
