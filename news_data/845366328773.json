He answers, “Nothing, but I’m tired of driving.”    The entrepreneur is making plans with Gary Nephew to open Ruhe@152 at 152 W. Market St. in Nappanee. The former Market Square Tap & Dine is getting a major overhaul from a bar and grill to a restaurant, brewery and sushi bar.    Tuttle wanted a nice place in Nappanee, something that approximates the experiences he has other places. Nephew wanted a brewery to produce the craft beer he and his friends relish. They came together to purchase the bar whose last day was St. Patrick’s Day.    Tuttle didn’t need another venture, but wanted Nappanee to have a place for business meetings or even a nice dinner out with friends or family. Local businesses are already contacting them to talk about potential events since there hasn’t been a local option.    “They go to Warsaw. They go to Elkhart, Goshen,” he said.    The menu will include good steaks and seafood, but also offer salads, sandwiches, soup and sushi. “It’s going to be affordable. It’s the atmosphere and experience we’re really going after,” said Tuttle.    Work is underway to gut the building, fix the bulging facade and instill something new. Ruhe will have a family dining area, private event space, upstairs lounge and brewery area. A large opening in the ceiling above the first floor will create a feature on the second. There could be as many as 325 seats inside when the place opens in late 2018 or early 2019.    The city of Nappanee vacated the alley next to the building, which is likely to yield outdoor seating.    The blend of atmosphere, size and the brewery will be attractive, Nephew said. A 10-barrel brewing system will be part of the establishment, but not the focus. Nephew, who is a pharmacist, has also started a hop farm with two others in Bremen. This year, they planted 2 acres that could produce the beer ingredient even for Ruhe’s own brews, with the potential to plant much more in future years.    “This is going to be a nice restaurant with a brewery. It’s not going to be a brewery with food,” Tuttle said.    They considered phasing in aspects of the business, but opted to go all-in from the beginning. “Let’s just do it and do it right,” Tuttle said.    Consultants have advised and construction is planned. Though the demolition isn’t finished inside, the owners are already hiring staff. David Michael, formerly of Evil Czech Brewing, will be the brewmaster. Distilling is in the works eventually, but Michael is already planning an apple mead for the 2019 Nappanee Apple Festival. They’re pleased with the applications they’re getting for chef.    Tuttle said the name can mean a lot of things, including peacefulness and rest, but the goal is to communicate this is a place to hang out. They don’t intend to be open later than 10 or 11 p.m. And they intend to have fun and offer a great experience.    Tuttle is already scheming how to assure service is spectacular and water glasses are filled.    “We really want to do it right,” said Tuttle.    He’s got a proven track record of starting successful businesses. Nephew operates two pharmacies with his wife. If their business sense comes together in a restaurant that meets even their own expectations, it’ll be great for Nappanee.    “Our goal is to create a space, an environment and a culinary experience that people will find worthy of a trip to our small town,” Tuttle said.    Readers have said time and time again how much Nappanee needs a place like this so people who live in southern Elkhart County don’t have to head elsewhere. For those folks, the opening of Ruhe@152 can’t come soon enough.    I’m hungry. Let’s eat.","contentWithMarkup":"NAPPANEE — Scott Tuttle’s friends ask him what he knows about running a restaurant.
