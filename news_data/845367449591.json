Forecasters recorded the triple-digit temperature, the first such reading so far this year, at 3:22 p.m. at Austin’s main weather station at Camp Mabry.    Normally, temperatures peak around 90 degrees at this time of year, according to the weather service.    Temperatures at Austin-Bergstrom International Airport also matched a daily heat record set in 1990, hitting 100 degrees at 3:40 p.m.     3:50 p.m. update : Austin hit  100 degrees for the first time this year on Saturday afternoon, according to the National Weather Service.    Forecasters confirmed at 3:28 p.m. that the weather station at Camp Mabry recorded triple-digit temperatures.    This is the earliest point in the year that Austin has experienced 100-degree weather since 2011, when Austin first saw triple-digit temperatures on May 25.  That year , Austin survived a record-setting 90 days of triple-digit temperatures.    Last year,  Austin’s warmest on record , the first day of 100-degree weather happened on June 17.    Clouds are expected to increase Saturday evening, which will help keep overnight temperatures above 76 degrees.    But Austin could actually see some precipitation on Sunday. The weather service forecast calls for a 30 percent chance of rain, but at least temperatures will top out around 95 degrees.    Elevated humidity levels, though, mean higher heat index values – that means 95 could actually feel as hot as 105.    Humidity means more moisture in the air, which makes it harder to cool off through the evaporation of sweat. That inability to cool down effectively accounts for why it feels so sticky outside and why it feels hotter than what the thermometer says.     Rain chances will persist at around 20 percent Sunday night.    Earlier : Austin dodged triple-digit temperatures on Friday but meteorologists say Saturday could be the day. The National Weather Service has put highs at 100 degrees but say it will likely feel even hotter — more like 108 — with the addition of elevated humidity.    Gauges at Austin’s main weather station at Camp Mabry at 9 a.m. measured a sultry 79 degrees under overcast skies. The weather service expects those clouds to linger through the morning before giving way to sunshine and stifling midday heat.    Last month shaped up to be the warmest May on record since 1996, according to the weather service, despite temperatures failing to hit the 100-degree mark.     Based on records going back to the late 1890s, the first 100-degree day normally arrives in Austin around July 10, but it has come as early as May 4, which happened in 1984.    Highs on Friday hit 99 at Camp Mabry, just shy of triple digits.    On Saturday, southerly Gulf winds measuring 5 to 10 mph will keep things warm and muggy, according to forecasters, with increasing cloud cover expected at night as temperatures drop to a low around 76.    The weather service says showers and thunderstorms are possible on Sunday and Monday but chances are slight at only 20 percent.    Here is a look at the extended forecast:    ﻿Sunday:  20 percent chance of showers and thunderstorms most likely after 8 a.m.; partly sunny becoming partly cloudy with highs at 96, lows at 76 and a heat index of 104.     ﻿Monday:  20 percent chance of showers and thunderstorms; partly sunny becoming partly cloudy with highs at 97 and a low around 74     Tuesday:  Clear skies and sunny and hot, with a high around 98 and low around 75.    Wednesday:  Clear skies and sunny and hot, with a high around 99 and low around 75.
