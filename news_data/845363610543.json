You don’t have to use these links, but I am grateful to you if you do. American Express, Citibank, Chase, Capital One and other banks are advertising partners of this site. Any opinions expressed in this post are my own, and have not been reviewed, approved, or endorsed by my advertising partners. I do not write about all credit cards that are available -- instead focusing on miles, points, and cash back (and currencies that can be converted into the same). Hilton’s standard promotion this quarter is double points. It runs through August 31 and registration is required. Stephen Pepper points out that this is even sweeter for co-brand credit card holders who earn triple points in July. No separate enrollment required. The Hilton Honors American Express Aspire Card offers 14 points per dollar spent with Hilton properties. Diamonds earn 20 points per dollar plus this bonus offer as a cardmember generates an additional 20, for a total of 54 points per dollar spent, which I view as being equivalent to a 21.6% rebate. The other Hilton cards, Hilton Honors Ascend Card from American Express. Initial bonus of up to 100,000 point after $3,000 in purchases within your first 3 months. Plus earn a free weekend night award after your first anniversary of cardmembership. This limited-time offer ends June 27, 2018. Each year you spend $15,000 on the card you’ll earn a weekend night reward, and $40,000 in a calendar year earns Hilton Diamond status through the end of the next calendar year. Ongoing earn is 12 Hilton points per dollar on purchases directly with a participating hotel or resort within the Hilton Portfolio; 6 per dollar at U.S. restaurants, U.S. supermarkets, and U.S. gas stations; and 3 per dollar for all other eligible purchases. The Hilton Honors American Express Business Card is offering 125,000 Hilton Honors bonus points after you spend $5,000 in purchases on the Card in your first 3 months of cardmembership. This is a limited-time offer that ends June 27, 2018. The card earns 12X at hotels & resorts in the Hilton portfolio, 6X on select business and travel purchases, and 3X everywhere else. You’ll get complimentary Hilton Gold status just for having the card. $15,000 spend in purchases in a calendar year earns a weekend night reward as well, and another weekend night after you spend an additional $45,000 in purchases on your Card in the same calendar year. Hilton Honors Card from American Express has no annual fee Hilton card and is offering a 75,000 point initial bonus after $1000 in eligible purchases within the first 3 months of cardmembership. This is a limited-time offer that ends June 27, 2018. Earning is 7 points per dollar at Hilton Honors properties; 5 points per dollar at U.S. restaurants, U.S. supermarkets, and U.S. gas stations; 3 points per dollar on other purchases. Conrad Maldives Lucky notes at One Mile at a Time that at a rate of 54 points per dollar it would take just $1760 in Hilton spend to generate 95,000 points. That’s the most expensive price for a base room at a Hilton property and those properties can go for over $1000 a night. So depending on how you redeem your points and how much you value the redemption your rebate value can be higher still.
