I don’t do the rides.”    She was born in 1926, the same year the park opened in Elysburg – and has been coming with her family and friends for the past 22 years.    And even though rides aren’t her thing, there’s plenty more that she enjoys.    “We play miniature golf, we eat ice cream cones, we watch the merry go round, and we like just being here,\" MacDonald, of Narberth, Montgomery County, said.    That widespread appeal is likely the reason why the National Amusement Park Historical Association crowned Knoebels as its Favorite Traditional Park for the sixth year in a row.    Owner and manager Brian Knoebel says it’s the park’s unique features that make it stand out from others.    “Grandma and grandpa will get most satisfaction out of watching their grandchildren ride rides than if they ride the rides themselves. So when they go to another park, they have to pay for parking – you don’t at Knoebels. They have to pay for admission – you don’t at Knoebels. They can come to Knoebels and not pay a single nickel,\" Knoebel said.    In addition to being the nation’s favorite traditional amusement park. Knoebels also has its favorite wooden coaster. Its won top honors seven years in a row.     “We stood in line and got the front seat. It was very fast, flying out of my seat, but all safe. Amazing,\" Vanessa Minnich, of Schuylkill Haven, said.    Phoenix isn’t just an attraction for local thrill seekers though, the Rollercoaster Club of Great Britain made Knoebels the first stop on its 16-day tour of amusement parks across the country.    Chairman Andy Hine has taken a ride on more than 2,000 different rollercoasters all over the world. He’s been to the park about 50 times and says the Phoenix is by far his favorite.    “We flew from London, we got off the plane, we traveled from Newark to here. And we started on the Phoenix for one hour. That’s 26 hours of traveling and we didn’t finish before going to bed having ridden the rollercoaster, the Phoenix, fifteen times,\" Hine said.    He says the laidback, family-friendly atmosphere at Knoebels is what makes him come back.    “You don’t feel that some big corporation is trying to take all your dollars off you and you can come here and just enjoy yourself,\" Hine said.    NAPHA also named Disneyland and Disney World as its top theme parks and Busch Gardens in Virginia as its Most Beautiful Park.","contentWithMarkup":"ELYSBURG, NORTHUMBERLAND COUNTY (WOLF) -- Betty MacDonald loves Knoebels Amusement Park.    “I mean it’s a nice place, everybody can do their own thing.
