There needs to be an end game and that is something that is definitely being talked about.  I can’t get into all of that. But all of that will be answered.” Lincoln lives in England with his family and commutes to the US to film ‘The Walking Dead’.  Other than the AMC series, Lincoln hasn’t sought roles in any other projects.  He may just want to take things easy and spend more time with his family.  He is expected to appear in six out of the 16 new episodes in season nine. Lauren Cohan, who plays Maggie, will also only be appearing in six episodes, as she has been cast in the new ABC series ‘Whiskey Cavalier’, which will debut midseason.  AMC has signed Norman Reedus to a new $20 million contract that would make Daryl Dixon the main character on ‘The Walking Dead’ from this point on.
