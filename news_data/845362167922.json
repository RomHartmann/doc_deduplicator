Nyle is an avid advocate for ASL since out of the estimated 70 million deaf people in the world, only 2% have access to education through sign language.    I had to chance to spend time with Nyle a while back and learned deaf folks appreciate even a small effort in learning to communicate with them. Plus, it's fun.    In this first video, Nyle teams up with gender queer artist Chella Man to teach basic queer signs like gay, bisexual, lesbian, trans, drag and more.     Y’all have been asking for queer signs! @chellamanart and I are teaching!!
