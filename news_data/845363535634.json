(WKRC) - Katie and Eric Klear's high school graduation was a little more special than most. The twins celebrated their accomplishment together as the valedictorian and salutatorian of their class.    The Klear twins went to Bishop Brossart High School. They performed in several plays during their high school years. Like most twins, they share a special bond.    \"Sometimes we're in sync all of the time,\" Eric said. \"Right, I know everything about him, he knows everything about me. We're just as close as two people could be, I think,\" Katie said.    Their GPA's are also close. Last weekend at graduation, Katie was the valedictorian with a 4.57 GPA. Eric was the salutatorian with a 4.5 GPA. Receiving the honor didn't surprise either one of them.    \"We could kind of guage how we were performing in classes,\" Eric said. \"We knew we were taking the highest level of classes,\" Katie added. \"Just because we like to challenge ourselves.\"    It was only fitting that Katie was first in the class. She was born first - 11 minutes before Eric.    \"I would like to say I was surprised but obviously they're very talented students,\" said Dan Ridder, the principal of Bishop Brossart High School.    Ridder said he wasn't surprised at all. Katie and Eric are overachievers who push one another to do their best which made their high school graduation more special.    \"Everyone was like wow, that's awesome. Val and sal, brother and sister,\" Katie said. Eric added, \"I really liked it. It was cool. It was very special for me.\"    Katie will attend Columbia College in Chicago in the fall. She wants to study creative writing and hopes to direct films. Eric will attend the University of Cincinnati and wants to study acting.","contentWithMarkup":"(WKRC)      ALEXANDRIA, Ky.
