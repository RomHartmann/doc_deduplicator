Two sides of the same coin, so to speak.  As a practical example: I prefer summer over winter.  I HATE puttin' on extra layers of clothes.  When winter rolls around, a skillful and appropriate response to the cold would be to ACCEPT the fact that it's now winter and put on those extra layers of clothes on to keep me warm.  It's in that ACCEPTANCE that the LETTING GO of my idea of \"I HATE puttin' on extra layers of clothes\" happens.  If I don't respond to winter in a skillful and appropriate manner by not ACCEPTING and LETTING GO  then I either never leave my apartment all winter or I don't put on the extra clothing and go outside and be cold.  Thank's for your question.  It gave me an opportunity to think about my practice.  Best Regards,  Sam On Jun 2, 2018, at 7:59 AM, Natalia Rodriguez <nataliar614@gmail.com> wrote: Hi all, I'm wondering if you have any readings/podcasts on compassion with borders and on acceptance/letting go that you'd recommend.
