{"sequenceId":"845363847770","id":"34207165639","language":"English","title":"FIRST ALERT FORECAST: More dangerous heat with some rain arriving Sunday","content":"No rain fell today, and it was hot! We do have a few clouds around this evening. Just about all those clouds will go away tonight, and it will be mostly clear by sunrise. I do not expect any rain tonight with the clouds clearing away. It will be a very warm and muggy night. Temperatures will only cool to the mid 70s. Some places will struggle to get out of the 80s.  Sunday will be another hot day with a few clouds in the morning. By the afternoon, we will see something we could all welcome: rain! There is a 30% chance we see a few showers in the afternoon. There could be a few storms and heavy rainfall associated in these showers. Not everyone will see rain, but those that do will have cooler temperatures. Heat indices before the rain will be in the triple digits, and after the rain it should feel like the 80s.  The rain should come to an end by the evening on Sunday with partly cloudy conditions overnight. Then by Monday, there will be only a 10% chance for some rain. I do not expect to see much rain if any at all. Temperatures will be hot once again with highs in the 90s.  Throughout most of the week, there is a slight chance for some rain to return. I have a 20% chance for a couple showers. It is abnormally dry, so any rain would be good. Highs will remain in the 90s in the afternoon. So, it will still feel very hot. Take a bottle of water with you if you spend any extended time outdoors.  Even with a 20% chance of some rain, not everyone will have a few showers, but it is better than what we had last week with only a 5-10% chance for some rain. Hopefully we do have some rain to help cool these temperatures. By next weekend, I have the rain chances back to 10%.  Also, as a heat reminder, know the signs of heat exhaustion versus heat stroke. Exhaustion will have excessive sweating, while heat stroke will have no sweating. That is one of the differences and a couple signs to look out for in this heat. Make sure to stay safe in the afternoon when the temperatures are at their highest.  Meteorologist Grant Roberts","contentWithMarkup":"No rain fell today, and it was hot!
