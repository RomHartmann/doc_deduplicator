Between August and October, the family allegedly stole cattle from half of the state's eight public livestock markets. \"The cattle producers were protected and received their money from the sale barn,\" Agriculture Commissioner Mike Strain said. \"However, the Thompsons never compensated the sale barn, so these businesses suffered significant financial losses.\" The thefts occurred in Allen, Avoyelles, East Baton Rouge and St. Landry parishes, the agency said.","contentWithMarkup":"Family accused of stealing livestock from four public markets","tags":["tag:allen parish","tag:animals","tag:avoyelles parish","tag:br-homepage","tag:business","tag:cows","tag:east baton rouge parish","tag:homepage","tag:news","tag:pets and animals","tag:pitkin","tag:st. landry parish","tag:vernon parish"],"publishedDate":"2018-06-02T16:53:52Z","harvestDate":"2018-06-02T21:21:06Z","estimatedPublishedDate":"2018-06-02T16:53:52Z","url":"http://ct.moreover.com/?a=34207097640&p=1u0&v=1&x=gMyqnYpOenc_D3PeIAJ2bw","originalUrl":"http://www.nola.com/crime/index.ssf/2018/06/pitkin_family_accused_of_takin.html","outboundUrls":[],"wordCount":"130","dataFormat":"text","duplicateGroupId":"34205921929","media":{"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[],"logo":[]},"publishingPlatform":{},"adultLanguage":"false","topics":[],"companies":[],"author":{"name":"Hanna Krueger","publishingPlatform":{}},"licenses":[],"source":{"name":"NOLA River","homeUrl":"http://blog.nola.com/nola_river/","location":{"country":"United States","countryCode":"US","region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America"},"feed":{"id":"304532292","name":"NOLA River","mediaType":"Blog","publishingPlatform":"Movable Type","generator":"Movable Type Enterprise 4.29-advance http://www.sixapart.com/movabletype/","tags":[],"language":"English","dataFormat":"Image","rank":{"autoRank":"10","autoRankOrder":"194399","inboundLinkCount":"0"},"inWhiteList":"true","autoTopics":[],"editorialTopics":["Society","Standard"]}},"es_id":86989867}
