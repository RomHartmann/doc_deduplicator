A production car that could kill the drag strip straight out of the factory deserves praises. And finally, it’s time for the Demon to bid farewell. The memorable event took place on Wednesday at the Fiat Chrysler Automobile’s Brampton, Canada plant, where the 3,300 th Challenger Demon rolled out of the factory.       The car doesn’t belong to anybody for now and Dodge doesn’t plan on preserving the car as a memorabilia. Instead, the last Demon will be auctioned off alongside the very last Dodge Viper at the Barrett-Jackson auction in Uncasville, Connecticut. All proceeds will go to United Way charity. The auction will take place on 22-23 June.     Related Posts        The final SRT Demon will be hand painted red to complement the Dodge Viper and will get a VIN instrument panel badge. The Demon holds significance because it’s the fastest production car in terms of achieving 0-60 mph acceleration and all that at a paltry $86,090 price tag. It would be interesting to see how much money the 2018 Dodge Challenger SRT Demon rakes up at the auction. The first SRT Hellcat went for $825,000 at Barret-Jackson 4 years back.
