Sieben-Chuback's name stuck out from the Saskatoon winners' list for a couple of reasons.

She drew it up as part her Entrepreneurship and Venture Development class (Comm 447) last semester, Swanson said.    \"The credit is all for her. She put her heart and soul into this,\" said Swanson.    \"We have had wonderful success over the past many years with students from the Comm 447 class commercializing their [local] businesses,\" he added, citing a modular building design firm and an online apparel shop.

So I looked into other methods of treatment and then that was kind of my inspiration moving forward into this industry.\"    While her store will primarily cater to recreational users, she does want to have \"a bit of an emphasis on that medical side,\" provided the SLGA rules allow for it.    She definitely knows what she wants to name her dispensary, though.    \"Living Skies Cannabis,\" she said. \"You know, [like] 'Land of the Living Skies.'\" That's the slogan on the Saskatchewan licence plates.
