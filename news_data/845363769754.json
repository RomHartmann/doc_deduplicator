School board members approved a 2 percent raise from the midpoint of the pay grade for each position Tuesday. The raises will increase payroll costs for the district by $2.648 million next school year.    “We wish we could do more,” said Northwest School Board Vice President Anne Davis-Simpson, who led Tuesday’s meeting. “According to the information we received, 2 percent is what most people are trying to do.”    Returning teachers will see a pay increase of $1,237 per year.    Along with giving the returning staff a raise, the district set the beginning teacher salary at $54,000. The salary for a 30-year teacher will be $68,950.    Northwest ISD Superintendent Ryder Warren passed along more good news for the staff, saying insurance premiums will not rise.    “The 2 percent raise in our compensation plan, they are going to get to keep it because there’s no changes in insurance premiums,” Warren said.    In other business, trustees appointed Judy Copp the new school board president during its annual reorganization. Copp has been on the board for six years and previously served two years as vice president.    “I’m excited, but nervous. I know I’ve got a good team to work with, which makes it worthwhile,” Copp said. “I graduated from here. I taught here for 31 years.”    Copp replaces Mark Schluter, who led the board the past two years.    “I want to thank you for your leadership. It’s been wonderful,” Simpson said during the meeting after being named vice president.    Lillian Rauch is the board secretary.    Ron Hastings joined the board for his first meeting. He was elected to fill the unexpired term of the vacant Place 7 seat. The term will end in 2021.    Trustees also approved the sale of $100 million in bonds from the May 2017 bond package. It is the first sale from the $399 million bond package.","contentWithMarkup":"<p>Northwest ISD employees will be getting a raise next school year.</p>\n<p>School board members approved a 2 percent raise from the midpoint of the pay grade for each position Tuesday.
