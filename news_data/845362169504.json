Depending on where you are, you could spend your entire vacation trying to figure out the system. And some very rare cases, it’s really the best way to see a city.    Most of the time, getting a rental will enhance your trip more than any other form of transportation.   Here are six reasons why you should get a rental vehicle for your next vacation:   Convenience – Decades ago, it may have been easier to hop in a cab, so you didn’t have to worry about printing out directions or getting lost. These days, it’s so much easier to hop in a rental vehicle and turn on the GPS. Getting lost isn’t much of a worry because the navigation will reroute you. You don’t have to figure out bus schedules or wait for taxi cabs. Just hop into your rental car and go!    And if you’re thinking about taking your own car, there are other factors to consider. With a rental, you don’t have to worry about service or maintenance. You should get a problem-free vehicle to use for your vacation.    Speed – You don’t necessarily have to break speed records to save time with a rental car. Instead of waiting around for a bus that only comes every 30 minutes or a cab that may or may not show up, you can make a quick decision about where to go and then be on your way.    And if you do want to break speed records, consider a supercar rental . The Audi A6 is a great compromise for parents who want a performance vehicle that seats the whole family.    Comfort – When you rent a vehicle, it’s yours for the week. Choose one that comfortably fits your family and you’ll feel as much at home in the rental as you do in your car back home. Having the car also ensures that you won’t have to squeeze in the back seat of a taxi or on an over-crowded train. And if you have a big family, getting a rental SUV can save you from having to take two cabs everywhere you go.    Storage – When you’re going to spend an entire day away from the hotel, it helps to have a place for your stuff. Store a change of clothes, bathing attire or your comfy shoes in the car and make a pitstop whenever you need a refresh. This may seem like a trivial thing when you’re weighing transportation options, but it can prove to be invaluable during a day of intense sightseeing.    Freedom – Have you ever had to leave somewhere early because you wanted to catch the last bus or train out of there? When you have your own wheels, you aren’t on anyone’s schedule but your own. You can come and go as you please. What’s more, you’re free to double back to the hotel if you forgot something, and the trip won’t cost you extra. That kind of freedom gives your family the leeway to relax and enjoy yourselves. You don’t have to stress over anyone else’s timetable.    Savings – Depending on your trip and what kind of destinations you’ll visit, your rental car may save you money in the long run. You’ll have the upfront cost of the rental, of course, but you’ll save money on taxi cabs, Ubers, buses or trains. Sometimes, renting a car is the most economical option, especially if you can land a good deal. When you’re trying to figure out whether you’ll save money with a rental car, be sure to factor in all costs. This includes rental fees, gas, tolls and parking.    Getting a rental vehicle isn’t always the best option for your family vacation, but there are some definite benefits. While you’re deciding, think about the place you’re visiting and how car-friendly it may be. For example, if you’re traveling to New York city, traffic and expensive parking rates may making renting less desirable option. In most other cases, though, renting a vehicle can enhance your family vacation. At least, it’s worth a look.
