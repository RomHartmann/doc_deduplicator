The 80/20 matching grant from the Texas Parks and Wildlife Department will renovate 0.13 miles of an existing trail in the Northwest Park and pay for an entrance sign that will likely be located on Farm Road 1658.    Recreation Superintendent Chris Heasley said it’s the seventh TPWD grant the city has received. The 2014 grant paid for the hiking and biking trails, and a 2016 grant will pay for fencing around the park. Heasley said it will be a while before the city receives the money from this 2018 grant, which could take longer due to delays with TPWD caused by Hurricane Harvey.    “The [grant] process is not a quick one, and in the middle of the process Texas got hit by a hurricane,” Heasley said. “So [TPWD] sent everyone down to the coast, as they should.”    In the meantime the department is focused on maintenance of the OHV park and the 9.5 miles of hiking and biking trails.    “The trails are used daily,” Heasley said. “We’re pleased as can be with what we have right now. Every time I go out there, there’s at least one car parked. It seems to be popular… And we had over 17,000 visitors to the OHV park last year, and that’s a park that’s only open around 100 days a year.”","contentWithMarkup":"<p>The Bridgeport Parks and Recreation Department recently received a $20,000 grant for signage and trail maintenance at Bridgeport Adventure Park.</p>\n<p>The 80/20 matching grant from the Texas Parks and Wildlife Department will renovate 0.13 miles of an existing trail in the Northwest Park and pay for an entrance sign that will likely be located on Farm Road 1658.</p>\n<p>Recreation Superintendent Chris Heasley said it’s the seventh TPWD grant the city has received.
