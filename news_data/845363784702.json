She laughed and laughed as she pedaled the new tricycle around the track at Newbury Park High School. It was a chorus of joyful noise echoed by other students and staff members. The happiness on her face was contagious.    Riding around like that wasn’t something she was able to do before the school got a new, adaptive tricycle.    The tricycle, gifted to the school from nonprofit PAUSE4Kids, gives special needs students greater mobility and the opportunity to participate in outdoor leg strength exercises, all the while being included with their peers.    The tricycle has a low-to-ground seat, extended frame and pull-away handlebars and is valued at $3,500. PAUSE4Kids is a nonprofit serving Ventura County and surrounding areas. The organization provides information, support and services for children with special needs and their families.    Students like Levenson will be able to use the trike when participating in adapted physical education. The new trike was unveiled at a ceremony Thursday at the high school as students took their turn testing it out around the track.   Filling a need   It was in an individualized education plan meeting at the school that Levenson’s mother, Cyndi Levenson, and Sammi Stewart, an adapted physical education specialist, realized that an adaptive trike would allow Jennifer Levenson to be with her peers.    “One of her goals was pedaling on a bicycle,” Cyndi Levenson said. “And she could do it in the classroom environment on the stationary bike, but not outside. So we were asking why there was a difference.”    The mother and her attorney, Kathy Greco, a PAUSE4Kids member, asked why the school didn’t have equipment available — the trikes are expensive, they discovered, and the school didn’t have the funds to acquire one.    That’s when the nonprofit stepped in. Greco contacted the board of directors to seek scholarship funding for the three-wheel cycle that won’t just serve Jennifer Levenson but also students for years to come.    “There was an identified need and these folks jumped right in and helped out,” said Conejo Valley Unified School District Superintendent Mark McLaughlin. “... It shows the importance of an individualized education plan and support within the community to meet students’ needs.”        Autoplay    Show Thumbnails    Show Captions    Last Slide Next Slide     Cyndi Levenson got to watch her daughter go around the track Thursday and hear her laugh and cheer as she passed by.    “It’s great, when (I was sent) pictures of her riding it the first time, I got goosebumps,” Cyndi Levenson said. “It was so exciting. And she’s so happy and she can participate with the rest of her class now. Because now on bike day, she can get on the bike and move also and it’s not as stressful for her and she doesn’t have the anxiety she had before.”    She’s included — which is something the district and parent and community advocates have been pushing for this year , especially when it comes to students with special needs.   Riding around   Every Thursday, Sammi Stewart brings the 12 students out to the track to ride, and they love every second of it. They get on the cycles and take off. A couple of them even learned to ride just this year.    The school has bicycles and tricycles for the students, but the needs of a couple of students weren’t being met with the existing equipment — meaning they were left to ride stationary bikes.    “I have a couple students that bike riding without that (new) bike would be impossible,” Stewart said. “I have one student who has epilepsy and she also has vision impairment so when we put her on the bike, she just goes. ... Usually we have to hold her everywhere but this gives her the freedom and the independence that she didn’t have before.”    The trike may seem simple, but Stewart said it’s a “huge deal” for the students and the school.    “It’s amazing,” Stewart said as students passed her by.    Lisa Miller, assistant superintendent of student support services, said she appreciated the donation from PAUSE4Kids and the work of the Newbury Park High School staff to bring the tricycle to the campus.    “We can really do everything to support students to be more independent and do something all other kids love to do,” Miller said. “This adaptive bike is a wonderful example of inclusion in action.”               Read or Share this story: https://www.vcstar.com/story/news/education/2018/06/02/newbury-park-high-gets-new-adaptive-bike/629228","contentWithMarkup":"CLOSE       PAUSE4Kids presented Newbury Park High with a $3,500 adaptive tricycle to help special needs students during adapted physical education classes.
