He's sandwiched between Bayou Haven, a seven-room bed-and-breakfast that opened in 2014, and a house whose absentee owner rents it out as an Airbnb.    When Bayou Haven was built, Domangue said, its owners, Dawn and Juraj Pekarik, took steps to avoid opposition by the neighbors, negotiating deed restrictions that were drafted by the couple's attorney that promised the 12,000-square-foot structure would be used only as a bed-and-breakfast.       But he said the owners have not adhered to the property's zoning or the deed restrictions. Instead, he said, they've turned the building into an events venue, which isn't allowed under its residential zoning, which permits some limited non-residential uses, including a bed-and-breakfast, but not a reception hall.    \"Not every event, but many, are (held) outside: weddings, receptions. There's music, bands, outside speakers, sometimes karaoke,\" Domangue said. \"You hear it blaring away ... it's really obnoxious. Sometimes you can hear it inside with the air conditioning and television on.\"    Residents also worry about the traffic the events bring to a narrow, two-lane road that has deep ditches on either side and is poorly lighted, he said.    There are less obvious problems, too, he said, like the strain on cellphone reception caused by hundreds of additional users in the area and erosion to the bayou's banks when people decide to reach the venue by water and don't slow down their boats.    \"It's not only not neighborly. It's offensive to those of us who have lived on the bayou for 25 to 30 years,\" he said.    Dawn Pekarik said the owners have applied for a zoning change and are in legislative and judicial processes \"to fix the issue.\" She declined further comment on the advice of her attorney.    The Bayou Liberty Neighborhood Association sought help from St. Tammany Parish's code enforcement department, and Domangue said officials have been responsive.    The owners were cited for code violations and were taken before a parish administrative hearing officer who, Domangue said, told them to stop the illegal activities and seek a zoning change. He also fined them a few hundred dollars.    \"Within two weeks, they were having wedding receptions,\" he said.    The association finally sued the couple in 22nd Judicial District Court this spring to enforce the deed restrictions, but Domangue said the Pekariks filed for bankruptcy the same day that the matter was to come before Judge Richard Swartz, effectively blocking any possible injunctive relief for a year.    Meanwhile, the parties go on, Domangue said — every weekend and sometimes several during the week.    Now, there's a possibility of changes to St. Tammany Parish's zoning code that would allow event venues in some zoning classifications, something that the neighborhood is watching closely.    Parish Councilman Steve Stefancik, the sponsor of the proposed zoning change, said the parish needs to have something in its zoning code for such businesses to have some control over them.    The ordinance is on the agenda for the Parish Council's June 7 meeting after being approved by the Zoning Commission, but that approval has been appealed. Stefancik said the ordinance will be sent to the Planning and Zoning Commission for review and possible changes.    If the law is adopted, businesses like Bayou Haven would be able to seek a zoning change, but Stefancik said there are no guarantees they would get one.       \"If neighbors raise hell, chances are it’s not going to happen,\" he said.    He's also considering creating regulations for short-term rentals, which are popping up all over, particularly on the water, and causing problems in part because there are no rules on the books for them in Slidell.    The Bayou Liberty area has eight short-term rentals, he said.    But Domangue worries that the changes won't do much good, especially with people who he said ignore the rules already in place.    Stefancik's proposed ordinance would create three categories of reception venues: small, with a limit of 150 people; medium, fewer than 500; and large, more than 500. Small venues would be allowed in areas zoned neighborhood commercial, but the larger venues would be restricted to highway commercial zones.    \"Who is going to monitor it? Who will enforce it?\" Domangue asked, noting that enforcement would require doing headcounts of crowds. \"The parish is cutting back on all personnel,\" he said, referring to cuts being made in the wake of the loss of two sales taxes.    \"It's costing a lot of time and a lot of money to fight this,\" he said.    \"None of this should have ever occurred. They need to put teeth into this,\" he added, referring to the zoning law.","contentWithMarkup":"Lee Domangue, like many of his neighbors, moved to the Bayou Liberty area near Slidell for the peace and natural beauty it offers, but these days, the homeowners association president finds himself living between two properties that he says are shattering the neighborhood's quiet with noisy events, from weddings to parties with bands.
