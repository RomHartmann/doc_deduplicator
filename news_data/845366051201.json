Extent/reach: Floodplain streams, sloughs, and lakes along 86 river miles (mile 20-106). In many areas of the estuary, salinity levels increase to intolerable or lethal levels for estuarine biota (oysters, submerged aquatic vegetations, benthic invertebrates, etc). Extent/reach: Nearly 100 miles of brackish-water streams in the lower Apalachicola River and distributaries, plus approx. 110,000 acres of bays and sounds in the Apalachicola Bay system.  3.5 ft  In some areas of the estuary, salinity levels increase to intolerable or lethal levels for estuarine biota (oysters, submerged aquatic vegetations, benthic invertebrates, etc). Extent/reach: Nearly 100 miles of brackish-water streams in the lower Apalachicola River and distributaries, plus approx. 110,000 acres of bays and sounds in the Apalachicola Bay system.  4 ft  Essentially all (>99%) tupelo-cypress swamps in nontidal reaches of the annual floodplain are exposed and no longer inundated at 4 ft. Inundated wetland forests provide important habitat in March-May for the primary fish spawning season, and in June-Sept for the secondary spawning season and primary nursery season. Extent/reach: Approx. 19,000 acres of Tupelo-Cypress swamps bordering 57 miles of river (mile 21-78). About half of all streams and sloughs in nontidal floodplain become impassable at 4 ft, blocking access from main stem to floodplain for fish, fisherman, and hunters. Extent/reach: Floodplain streams, sloughs, and lakes along 86 river miles (mile 21-107).  6 ft  Barges and large boats cannot navigate the river (at Blountstown gage of 6 feet or lower, which is approximately equivalent to 13,000 cfs at Chattahoochee gage). Reach: Upper 86 miles (mile 21-107),especially at problems reaches (e.g. near Corley Slough).  7 ft  Most Tupelo-Cypress swamps in nontidal reaches of the annual floodplain are exposed and no longer inundated at 7 ft. Inundation in wetland forests March-May is important habitat for the primary fish spawning season, and also maintains healthy forest structure and species composition in swamps. Extent/reach: Approx. 19,000 acres of Tupelo-Cypress swamps bordering 57 miles of river (mile 21-78).
