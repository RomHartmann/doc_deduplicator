The convention to produce new set of national officers has been scheduled for June 23.    Addressing newsmen at his Abuja residence, Chief Oyegun said he took the decision to save the party from intractable rancour that could trail the outcome of the convention, as he noted that the recently conducted congresses have polarised the ruling party    He said: “ We have conducted the Congresses in all states of the federation and the FCT; and we have set a date for the national convention. Now that the convention committee has invited interested aspirants to obtain forms to contest into the various national positions in our party, it has become necessary for me  to state my position. I have consulted widely with my families, friends and associates. Even though, I had the desire to recontest as the national chairman of the party, I have decided that it is ultimately in the interest of the party for me to withdraw from the race.    “ I have taken this decision without prejudice to my commitment to the party in helping to solve some of the subsisting and emerging difficult issues and my ability to continue to provide necessary leadership. However, I believe that the party faces difficult days ahead, and all critical stakeholders in its leadership would be required to bind together for a common purpose.    “Therefore, the less contentious our national convention is, the better for the party. I have always sought to be part of solving the problem of the APC; I do not intend to be part of the problem for APC to solve. It is for this reason that I hereby declare that I will not be seeking reelection as the national chairman of the All Progressives Congress,APC.”    ALSO READ:  Oshiomhole’s aspiration: As defunct CPC, ACN blocks consolidate grip on APC    Saturday Tribune checks revealed that the governors on the party platform have since lined behind President Muhammadu Buhari  in his choice of former Edo state governor, Adams  Oshiomhole for the position of national chairman retained in the South south and Chief Oyegun’s home state of Edo.    Asked by newsmen if he felt betrayed by the volte face of the APC governors, Chief Oyegun said their position was informed by new realities within the party.    “I don’t feel betrayed, most of the party structures were behind me. But when realities change, when you are faced with new realities, of course, you must have a change of position.    They want a good deal for themselves, it isn’t that they want to pull out.”    The post appeared first on Tribune .","contentWithMarkup":"YEGUNThe national chairman of the All Progressives Congress (APC), Chief Odigie Oyegun,  last night formally declined interest in the race for the office of national chairman of his party.
