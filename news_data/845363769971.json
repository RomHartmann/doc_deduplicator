Though the county commissioners court still has to approve the official Tier 2 petition June 11, Wise Citizens for Property Rights President Bryson Boyd told the Messenger the elections office declared the petition valid May 25. Elections Administrator Sabra Srader said the number of signatures verified on the petition would not be made public until Monday, but the petition was signed by enough registered voters to proceed to commissioners.    The petition called for an election to decide whether Wise County falls under Tier 2 classification according to state law. In Tier 2 counties, cities cannot involuntarily annex land. In order to expand their boundaries, the cities must have the approval of the majority of landowners in the annexation area.    The Tier 2 petition, headed by Wise Citizens for Property Rights, began circulating last fall. When Boyd turned the petition in to the elections office, 6,118 signatures had been collected. Boyd estimated more than 5,000 of those were valid.","contentWithMarkup":"<p>The issue of involuntary annexation is heading to the November election.</p>\n<p>Though the county commissioners court still has to approve the official Tier 2 petition June 11, Wise Citizens for Property Rights President Bryson Boyd told the Messenger the elections office declared the petition valid May 25.
