Organised by New Ross woman Siobhan Sheppard, the event raised over €1,300 for the Irish Cancer Society and €500 for the family of Siobhán's friend Sarah Sweetman, from Arklow, who died from cancer in January, through donations and a raffle collection.     Thirteen men volunteered to be waxed by the talented ladies of Town & Country Mercantile's beauty salon who left them with legs smoother than Kim Kardashian, but not before some yelping and screams were let out to the amusement of onlookers. Paul Kelly was MC on the night and Kieran Rochford was DJ.    Siobhan said: 'It was amazing. I did this in honour of my Mam Joanne who died from cancer in 2016 and for Sarah who I trained with at Wexford General Hospital. I am so grateful to the midwives at Wexford General for coming and for all of the local support.'","contentWithMarkup":"A hairy dozen or so men were waxed and left bare legged all in the name of two good causes at Pauline's bar in Irishtown recently.
