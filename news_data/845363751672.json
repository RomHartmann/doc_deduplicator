{"sequenceId":"845363751672","id":"34207161637","language":"English","title":"UHV named best college in Katy for 3 years","content":"For the third year in a row, the University of Houston-Victoria has been named Best College in Katy by Katy Times readers.    “Receiving this recognition for the third year in a row is a great honor,” UHV President Vic Morgan said. “UHV takes its commitment to the community seriously, and we are grateful for their acknowledgement of our efforts.”    About 6,000 Katy Times readers took part in the Best of Katy voting process. Readers filled in ballots that were sent out in their newspapers and mailed their votes back to be tallied for the 2018 All the Best special section, which will be published Thursday.    UHV Katy opened in August 2016 at 2002 W. Grand Parkway N., Building 2. The university offers many degree programs and concentrations for transfer and graduate students at UHV Katy in addition to undergraduate and graduate degrees at its main residential campus in Victoria and online. On May 23, the UH System broke ground on the UH Katy building, which will house both UHV and UH degree programs once it opens in fall 2019.    “It’s exciting to see how much the Katy community appreciates the work UHV has done here,” said Karla DeCuir, senior director of enrollment management and external affairs at UHV Katy. “We are thankful that the Katy community recognizes the mission and vision UHV has to fulfill the community’s need for higher education.”    UHV has a history of partnering with higher education institutions in Katy. In addition to its own location, the university has partnered with Houston Community College for several years and previously offered classes at HCC Northwest in Katy and the former UH System at Cinco Ranch location. All those programs, along with other locations in Greater Houston, have been consolidated to UHV Katy.    UHV also has articulation agreements with HCC and the Lone Star College System that makes it easier for students to transfer from the community colleges into UHV.    In addition to partnerships with community colleges, UHV Katy regularly hosts public events and works to connect with the Katy community. Information sessions about the university’s programs are hosted monthly, and some UHV classes have helped the Katy community through free research projects. In one such project, students enrolled in a UHV marketing course helped collect and analyze data for the Fort Bend County Libraries. Earlier this year, students also helped the National Association of Steel Pipe Distributors, a business-focused nonprofit, create a social media plan.    “UHV is happy to be part of the Katy community, and we are always looking for ways to be involved and invest in our neighbors,” DeCuir said. “The university will continue to strive to meet the educational needs of Katy.”","contentWithMarkup":"For the third year in a row, the University of Houston-Victoria has been named Best College in Katy by Katy Times readers.    “Receiving this recognition for the third year in a row is a great honor,” UHV President Vic Morgan said. “UHV takes its commitment to the community seriously, and we are grateful for their acknowledgement of our efforts.”    About 6,000 Katy Times readers took part in the Best of Katy voting process.
