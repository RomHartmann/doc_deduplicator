But even in Agile, there is a beginning and an end to the sprint planning and project management.   Taking Agile to somehow mean endless in terms of adding more and more requirements or scope creep is not what is intended.    Agile has to be bound by common sense somewhere between what is needed for a minimally viable product (MVP) and what is achievable with the designated resources, objective, and scope.    Good project managers always have to be sound arbiters and be willing to ask the tough questions and determine if something is truly a requirement or simply a wish list item that is out of scope (but of course, could perhaps make it in for future enhancements).   We need to understand the difference between genuine customer service and irrational project exuberance based on inflated expectations.    It's not a dangerous project bubble we want to create that can and will get busted, but rather a successful project that is delivered for our customers that help them do their jobs better, faster, and cheaper.  ;-)   (Source Photo: Andy Blumenthal)","contentWithMarkup":"<p class=\"separator\"><a href=\"https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-zrSeuP3i1uQ/WxMEKoP1qgI/AAAAAAAAcD0/AUEdRn_FtQY_rKm7q68QzzYfYrxq9GPvACLcBGAs/s1600/IMG_2927.jpg\"><img src=\"https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-zrSeuP3i1uQ/WxMEKoP1qgI/AAAAAAAAcD0/AUEdRn_FtQY_rKm7q68QzzYfYrxq9GPvACLcBGAs/s640/IMG_2927.jpg\" width=\"640\" height=\"424\" border=\"0\" /></a></p>\n<span style=\"font-size:x-large;\">So Agile development is great for iteratively working closely with customers to develop and refine information systems that are useful to them and the organization.</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-size:x-large;\">\n</span><span style=\"font-size:x-large;\">But even in Agile, there is a beginning and an end to the sprint planning and project management.</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-size:x-large;\">\n</span><span style=\"font-size:x-large;\">Taking Agile to somehow mean endless in terms of adding more and more requirements or scope creep is not what is intended. </span>\n\n<span style=\"font-size:x-large;\">\n</span><span style=\"font-size:x-large;\">Agile has to be bound by common sense somewhere between what is needed for a minimally viable product (MVP) and what is achievable with the designated resources, objective, and scope. </span>\n\n<span style=\"font-size:x-large;\">\n</span><span style=\"font-size:x-large;\">Good project managers always have to be sound arbiters and be willing to ask the tough questions and determine if something is truly a requirement or simply a wish list item that is out of scope (but of course, could perhaps make it in for future enhancements).</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-size:x-large;\">\n</span><span style=\"font-size:x-large;\">We need to understand the difference between genuine customer service and irrational project exuberance based on inflated expectations. </span>\n\n<span style=\"font-size:x-large;\">\n</span><span style=\"font-size:x-large;\">It's not a dangerous project bubble we want to create that can and will get busted, but rather a successful project that is delivered for our customers that help them do their jobs better, faster, and cheaper.  ;-)</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-size:x-large;\">\n</span><span style=\"font-size:x-large;\">(Source Photo: Andy Blumenthal)</span>","tags":["Agile","application development","Arbiter","Comic","Common Sense","Customer Service","Desirement","Dilbert","Expectations","Irrational Exuberance","Iterative","Minimally Viable Product","Photo","Project Management","requirements management","Scope","Sprint","Wish List"],"publishedDate":"2018-06-02T21:22:41Z","harvestDate":"2018-06-02T21:22:49Z","estimatedPublishedDate":"2018-06-02T21:22:41Z","url":"http://ct.moreover.com/?a=34207105482&p=1u0&v=1&x=zbVd3SL-TIf-mpotsaPAdA","originalUrl":"https://andyblumenthal.wordpress.com/2018/06/02/agile-doesnt-mean-endless/","outboundUrls":["https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-zrSeuP3i1uQ/WxMEKoP1qgI/AAAAAAAAcD0/AUEdRn_FtQY_rKm7q68QzzYfYrxq9GPvACLcBGAs/s1600/IMG_2927.jpg"],"wordCount":"201","dataFormat":"text","duplicateGroupId":"34207105482","media":{"audio":[],"images":[{"url":"https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-zrSeuP3i1uQ/WxMEKoP1qgI/AAAAAAAAcD0/AUEdRn_FtQY_rKm7q68QzzYfYrxq9GPvACLcBGAs/s640/IMG_2927.jpg"}],"video":[],"logo":[]},"publishingPlatform":{"itemId":"18798"},"adultLanguage":"false","topics":[],"companies":[],"author":{"name":"Andy (Avraham) Blumenthal","publishingPlatform":{"userId":"23664891"}},"licenses":[],"source":{"name":"andyblumenthal","homeUrl":"https://andyblumenthal.wordpress.com","location":{},"feed":{"id":"188429770","name":"andyblumenthal","mediaType":"Blog","publishingPlatform":"WordPress","idFromPublisher":"23460670","generator":"http://wordpress.com/","description":"Thoughts About Leadership, Technology, and Life","tags":[],"language":"English","dataFormat":"text","rank":{"autoRank":"10","autoRankOrder":"194399","inboundLinkCount":"0"},"inWhiteList":"true","autoTopics":[]}},"es_id":86990093}
