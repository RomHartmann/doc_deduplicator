The 'Orange Is the New Black' star refuses to entertain her critics and thinks that is \"super important\" that she doesn't engage with those who post negative comments.    She told Gay Times magazine: \"There's s**t going down in the comments section where people are so mean and hateful to each other. That's an unfortunate side effect of social media, but free speech brings that and we have to learn to fortify ourselves when all that comes at us; I'm saying that to myself now. I try to stop reading when I see negative stuff and I don't ever engage with anything negative - that's super important.\"    Meanwhile, the 46-year-old actress previously admitted she feels being a black transgender woman has limited her opportunities as an actress.    She explained: \"Two years ago ... I was in the waiting room with actresses who were like, 'Oh my God, this is my fourth audition today.' And I was like, 'Oh, I've never auditioned that much.' There have never been that many parts as a black, openly transgender woman. Because I am who I am, there probably have been fewer opportunities for me to work. I feel like we've made the very most of what we have been given ... I feel very blessed now.    \"Certainly there are fewer opportunities for someone like me being black and being trans and being a woman. In the face of that, it's not bad. The truth is I'm one of the lucky ones. The question for me becomes ... as I produce, how to bring other people along for the ride.\"","contentWithMarkup":"Laverne Cox won't read negative comments about herself.
