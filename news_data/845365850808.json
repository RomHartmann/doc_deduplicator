The group is suing the Kent County Clerk's Office on behalf of all of Michigan saying its trained members should be allowed to officiate weddings.  \"You know how important weddings are to people and to families,\" Beahan said. \"It's a major life event and secular individuals should be able to celebrate that in a way that they want that's most memorable and meaningful to them.\"  While people who don't want to have a religious wedding can head to city hall or the courthouse, this group says that is still hardly equal.  \"You have to do it on their schedule. They provide you a copy of the vows that they read for you and you don't get to have it at the place of your time and choosing. You don't get to personalize it,\" she said.
