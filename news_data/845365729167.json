(Photo: Contributed by Julio Vasquez)      SAN ANGELO — Police have hailed seven San Angelo residents as \"heroes\" after they rushed in to save a mother and her two children from a car dangling off the embankment on Loop 306 Friday morning , June 1, 2018 .    Shortly after 8 a.m., Heather Santellano, a 36-year-old San Angelo woman and her two children, \"a 9-year-old girl and 10-year-old boy,\" were traveling eastbound on the Houston Harte Expressway near Glenna Street in a 2012 Mazda sedan when \"a red pickup cut (Santellano) off,\" said Tracy Gonzalez, the San Angelo Police Department's public information officer.     Santellano tried to avoid the pickup, \"which caused her to leave the roadway and go down the embankment of the loop,\" Gonzalez said.    While the undercarriage of the vehicle helped prevent it from dropping off the embankment into oncoming traffic, \"her vehicle was teetering off the edge.\"    \"It was just terrifying because my kids were in the back seat,\" Santellano said.    Thanks to the actions of seven nearby good Samaritans, police arrived to find Santellano and her two children safe and outside the vehicle.    \"Orig-Equip, Inc. employees Reid Myers, Jacob Rodriguez, and Paul Guevarra quickly sprang into action with the help of Patrick Davidson, employed by Allstar Pro Services, and three Premier Automotive employees, Adrian Martinez, Julio Vasquez, and Marco Vasquez,\" the release stated.     San Angelo Police hailed these seven citizens as 'heroes' after they saw a car dangling from the overpass off loop 306 and rushed in to save its occupants.

Julio Vasquez and his nephew Marco Vasquez were returning to Premier Automotive after testing out a vehicle when they saw the Mazda hanging from the brink of the embankment.    \"I told my nephew to drop me off and run back to the shop and grab a strap,\" Julio Vasquez said.     While some members of the group worked together to put their body weight on the car’s trunk, \"others tethered the Mazda to Myers’s Ford-F30,\" the release stated.    \"We leaned on the car and kept the car down,\" Rodriguez said, adding he could see the children inside the Mazda.    After it was securely tethered, Rodriguez said he and the others felt it was safe enough to open the Mazda's doors to get all three occupants out of the car.    \"As soon as the door opened, we had to start leaning on the vehicle harder,\" Rodriguez said. \"It was a very tense situation. (The mother and children) were shaken up.  Another foot, and this would be a different story.\"    As the children escaped from the Mazda, Vasquez said the vehicle started rocking toward the edge of the embankment.     Fearing the worst, Vasquez said he and the others yelled for Santellano to quickly get in the back seat.    \"'Jump on the back! Jump on the back!' we shouted,\" Vasquez said. \"It was pretty intense.\"    Police arrived to find all occupants of the Mazda safely out of the vehicle.      San Angelo Police have hailed seven citizens as 'heroes' after they saw a car dangling from the overpass off loop 306 and rushed in to save its occupants, a San Angelo mother and two children.

Your instincts just kick in.\"    Santellano expressed her gratitude toward everyone who helped her and her children escape what she described was a \"terrifying situation.\"    \"People surrounded the car almost immediately to help us get out safely and I couldn’t be more grateful,\" Santellano said. \"Witnesses, the Orig-Equip and Premiere Auto guys, and the police officers were all incredible.\"    Police are asking the public for help identifying the driver of the red pickup truck, or if they know the driver's whereabouts, to call Officer Steven Quade at 325-657-4253.
