Adams beat strong contenders including Wood, McIntyre, Emmerdale’s Jeff Hordley and Doctors’ Chris Walker.  He told the crowd: “Oh my word, this is really, really unbelievable. I think Hollyoaks does issue-based storylines really well, and I’m hugely proud of them for telling this story as well as they did.”  He added: “I love soap, I love all of the soaps. Years ago when I sat working as a PA to the producer of Coronation Street, I never thought I’d be stood here collecting an award and this is just the icing on the cake.”  Wood, who plays Max Branning, had his sole win in the scene of the year category where the prize was split for the first time in British Soap Award history.  Taking to the stage, Wood sent a special message to his former co-star, Dame Barbara Windsor.  He said: “Can I send a big EastEnders’ hug out to Barbara Windsor and her husband Scott.
