Her intellect, passion and friendship has meant more to us than we can even begin to convey. She was more than a co-worker; she was a friend, a mother, grandmother, daughter and wife and gave all of herself to her family, her friends and her work.   Veleria was a treasured member of our work family. She brought joy, calmness, warmth and compassion to all that she did. She was a dedicated mother, wife and daughter. She and her family shared a deep passion for music and their faith.     On Thursday, forensic psychiatrist Steven Pitt was gunned down outside of his Scottsdale office, police said. Pitt had been a consultant on on a number of high-profile cases — including Phoenix's Baseline Killer serial shooter, who killed nine people between August 2005 and June 2006, and JonBenét Ramsey, who was found dead the day after Christmas in 1996.      Witnesses told police they heard a loud argument before Thursday's killing followed with gunshots, Phoenix Police Sgt. Vince Lewis said Friday. Pitt was pronounced dead at the scene.    The shooter fled the area. Witnesses described the shooter as an adult male, bald and wearing a dark-colored hat with a short brim, Lewis said.     Follow Bree Burkitt on Twitter: @breeburkitt        Autoplay    Show Thumbnails    Show Captions    Last Slide Next Slide     .
