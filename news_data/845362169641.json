He passed away two days later from his injuries.    Parker's Uncle and members of His Tabernacle Family Church held a \"A Ride for Mikey\" to help pay for funeral expenses.    About 50 motorcyclists traveled throughout the area in memory of Parker.    His youth paster says Parker didn't live in the area that long, but he still left a huge impact.    \"He's a great kid, lit a room up everytime,\" said Cody Spencer, His Tabernacle Family Church youth pastor. \"So, we spent an extensive amount of time with him, and just that smile and laugh was very different but was contagious, so we're going to miss those things about him.\"    Parker's family also made a GoFundMe page.    If you're interested in donating, you can find the link on our website.","contentWithMarkup":"16-year-old Michael Parker nearly drowned on Memorial Day near the gravel pits off of East Franklin Street, between Route 13 and Old Ithaca Road.
