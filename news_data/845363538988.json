Wes says the suspect tried to stab him multiple times, but he walked away with only one stab wound just one centimeter away from his heart.    \"If he wouldn't have gotten to the door and held it, it was just that amount of time allowed me to get to the door,” says his younger brother, Matt. “So we both got to the door and he stabbed him and I was holding the door back and the police officers tazed him two to three times, that I saw, before they had to open fire.\"    That suspect died at the hospital from one gun shot fired by Salisbury Police. There was a pregnant woman in the suspect’s truck, police say she’s still in the hospital and is not facing any charges at this time.
