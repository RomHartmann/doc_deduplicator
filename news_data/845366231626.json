Just six days after an area restriction was put in place around the blaze, the restriction has now been lifted by the BC Wildfire Service.    \"Firefighting personnel no longer need to restrict public access to operate efficiently in the area,\" says the province, adding other dangers may be present so members of the public should be aware.    \"Trees that have been damaged by fire might be unstable and could fall down. Ash pits can be hard to detect and can remain hot long after the flames have died down.\"    The area restriction was set up following the evacuation of 14 properties in the area last week. Another 51 were put on evacuation alert as the fire grew to over 2,700 hectares in size.    However the BC Wildfire Service lifted the evacuations and alerts as cooler weather arrived starting Tuesday.    Although the fire is 100 per cent contained, the fire is still an active worksite and nearby communities can expect to see smoke within the fire's perimeter over the coming weeks.","contentWithMarkup":"SAVONA, B.C. — Yet another sign wildfire crews have gotten a handle on the Allie Lake wildfire north of Savona.
