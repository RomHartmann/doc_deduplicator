The Victoria Advocate deserves our thanks and gratitude for their article exposing the closed meeting hiring of ex-congressman Blake Farenthold, who squandered the taxpayers’ money, then didn’t follow through on his promise to pay them back.    Calhoun Port Authority board members hired this politician? And then held another meeting so they could correct a misdeed for not following the Open Meetings Act. Half of the Calhoun Port Authority board still voted to hire this person, who used $87,000 to pay off a sexual harassment claim, then quit his elected position and is now causing you and me, the taxpayers, the cost of a special election. Those board members need to wake up! How long are the taxpayers going to put up with this waste?    Joe Kovar, veteran and taxpayer, Victoria","contentWithMarkup":"Editor, the Advocate:    Yes, yes!
