You can start out with The Women of the Moose as they cook you breakfast at the Moose Club from 9:00 AM to 1:00.  Arts in the Park 2018 kicks off with a free concert at Oak Park from 5:00 PM to 8:00 PM.  The Souris Valley Sabre Dogs take the field (Corbett Field) against The Hub City Hotshots at 5:30 PM weather permitting.  Get Down, Get Dirty as the Nodak Speedway Magic City Dirt Series kicks off at 7:00 Pm and runs to 10:00 PM.  Here are a few random things I saw in the news paper I thought worthy of mentioning:  New Town ND, Tribal tourism season opens with Earth Lodge Village Event.  The Roosevelt Park Pool has opened for the season. This is Minot's only public pool. As could be expected Minot's temps have been in the 80's and 90's... now that the pool opened our high today is supposed to be around 65 and so is the wind speed.  The Minot Area Council of the Arts (MACA) is hosting a karaoke & BBQ Fundraiser in Oak Park Sunday from 5:00 to 8:00 PM.  I'm sure there is more but that's what I have for you for tomorrow, Sunday June 3rd 2018.
