Numerous buildings and homes in Ralls suffered damage. Three compress warehouses on the north side of U.S. Highway 62-82 were destroyed with debris blown across the highway to the south. The available evidence strongly suggests that the damage was the result of a downburst that moved generally from north to south across the community of Ralls. In general, the damage was consistent with wind speeds in the 80 to 90 mph range.    The supercell thunderstorm, which caused the damage at Ralls, continued to move east-southeast, producing large hail and severe winds that also resulted in damage in the communities of Crosbyton and Spur.    UPDATE 10:00 a.m. Saturday:     Xcel energy crews worked through the night. A company spokesman says power has now been restored to nearly everyone in Ralls and Crosbyton.    12 customers west of Ralls remain without power. The company should have power restored here by 1 p.m. Saturday.     According to an Xcel media release, the storm destroyed 22 power line structures and 20 cross arms. There were 20 spans of line down in one area, with wire blown 300 yards from the utility right-of-way.     \"We’re proud of the employees who worked all night to rebuild these lines, and are thankful no one was injured,\" spokesman Wes Reeves said. \"We appreciate the understanding of our customers who endured a very warm evening without air conditioning.\"    Click here - for storm reports received by the National Weather Service. The NWS will have a survey crew in Ralls Saturday to assess the damage. A gust of 69mph was clocked on the Texas Tech Mesonet one mile SE of Ralls at 5:45 p.m. Friday.    update 1:35 a.m. Saturday:    News release from Xcel Energy:    A severe storm has severed a high-voltage electric transmission link that feeds the towns of Crosbyton, Ralls, and outlying rural communities. Approximately 2,400 customers in these communities are without power and will remain without power overnight and well into the day on Saturday.    We have called in crews from around the area to rebuild the damaged lines and are expecting to have repairs made and customers restored by 4 p.m. Saturday. We apologize for the inconvenience and are doing everything possible to speed this process in a safe manner.    Due to the high temperatures expected in the area, we urge customers to find shelter from the heat, drink plenty of fluids and watch for signs of heat illness. We also urge customers to check on neighbors and family members who may need additional assistance.    posted 7:19 p.m., updated 9:58 p.m. Friday: Severe storms produced damage east of Lubbock, including in Ralls and Crosbyton.    The Crosby County Sheriff's Office reports power was knocked out in Ralls when strong wind hit a cotton compress. Several utility poles were downed. Debris was spread across Highway 114/U.S. 82, stopping traffic.     Deputies told our news crew Friday evening they were evaluating what other damage occurred and what help neighbors need. No one was reported hurt.     It will take utility crews a while to restore power.     There were a few other reports of sporadic power outages farther east, but not as widespread as what we know in Ralls and Crosbyton.     Storms have moved east of Crosby County. No more severe weather is expected tonight or Saturday. ","contentWithMarkup":"UPDATE 5 p.m. Saturday:    Meteorologists with the National Weather Service in Lubbock conducted a ground damage survey in Ralls.
