She posted: \"I see the media is working overtime speculating where I am & what I'm doing\".      However, many social media users were skeptical Melania Trump herself wrote that tweet.    Usually the first lady would accompany the President to Camp David, a Maryland retreat, but President Trump travelled solo on Friday afternoon.    Her absence will mark 22 straight days without a public appearance by the first lady following a recent hospitalisation. In April, she represented her husband's administration at former first lady Barbara Bush's funeral.    Then, on May 14, the 48-year-old was hospitalized for a benign kidney condition for which she required an embolization procedure and spent the following week recovering. She has been meeting with staff and working on projects, according to her spokeswoman. \"We are focusing on her initiatives, and also some longer term planning for events such as the congressional picnic and 4th of July\", Trump's spokesperson Stephanie Grisham told the Mail in a prepared statement.    This all comes just after Mrs. Trump's most high-profile period as First Lady. \"She's looking at us, right there\", People Magazine reported.    Melania Trump's more than three-week absence has spurred conspiracy theories, including that she has moved back to NY.    But Melania's nonattendance is always newsworthy: On Wednesday, People reported that it was Ivanka, not Melania, who helped the president host \"White House Sports and Fitness Day\".","contentWithMarkup":"She has not been seen publicly since the early hours of May 10, when she joined the President at Andrews Air Force Base to welcome three American detainees home from North Korea.
