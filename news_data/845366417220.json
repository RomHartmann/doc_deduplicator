To add to the mass confusion, Danielle also got married (back in January 2017) and wore a white wedding dress.    So that’s two women who are mixed race, have freckles and dark hair, and were once a bride.       Danielle’s wedding was a little different to Prince Harry and Meghan Markle’s, costing $50,000 – just 0.001% of the price of the royal wedding.       According to  Metro UK , she said,     ‘My husband and I were in the Gucci store in Dallas and they were taking so long to wrap up my things I couldn’t understand it,’ says Danielle. ‘Until all the sales associates came out of the back to meet me. It was so funny. ‘On Friday I was standing in the grocery store line and this old lady in front of me had a magazine with Meghan on it.        She started doing a double take and said “ Has anyone ever told you ..” but I just finished her sentence for her. Everyone always tells me “ Danielle, you need to get a job as her double ”.    My husband even jokes that he’d be my manager. ‘ It was four years ago when a mutual friend first said to me that I look just like Rachel Zane, Meghan’s character in Suits.    ‘I didn’t watch the show then, but I couldn’t see the similarities when she showed me the picture.’   More photos below:            Leave a Comment…   comments    The post Meet the woman who says she gets mistaken for newly royal wed, Meghan Markle appeared first on INFORMATION NIGERIA .","contentWithMarkup":"<p>Danielle Harris is a 33-year-old from the U.S. who is claiming she gets mistaken for Meghan Markle at least four times a week.</p>\n<p>To add to the mass confusion, Danielle also got married (back in January 2017) and wore a white wedding dress.</p>\n<p>So that’s two women who are mixed race, have freckles and dark hair, and were once a bride.</p>\n<p><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-275759\" src=\"http://www.informationng.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/meet-the-woman-who-says-she-gets-mistaken-for-newly-royal-wed-meghan-markle.jpg\" alt=\"\" /></p>\n<p>Danielle’s wedding was a little different to <a href=\"https://www.yabaleftonline.ng/prince-harry-smiles-bride-meghan-arrives-givenchy-dress/\" data-wpel-link=\"external\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow external noopener noreferrer\">Prince Harry</a> and Meghan Markle’s, costing $50,000 – just 0.001% of the price of the royal wedding.</p>\n<p><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-275760\" src=\"http://www.informationng.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/meet-the-woman-who-says-she-gets-mistaken-for-newly-royal-wed-meghan-markle-1.jpg\" alt=\"\" /></p>\n<p>According to <strong>Metro UK</strong>, she said,</p>\n<blockquote class=\"td_quote_box td_box_center\">\n<p>‘My husband and I were in the Gucci store in Dallas and they were taking so long to wrap up my things I couldn’t understand it,’ says Danielle. ‘Until all the sales associates came out of the back to meet me.
