After several exoplanet discoveries over the past decades, they have figured out what kinds of places could have a climate that is conducive to life. For instance, Saturn’s moon Enceladus and Jupiter’s moon Europa are prime candidates in search of life beyond Earth. Both moons display hydrothermal activity and habor oceans beneath their icy crust.      Scientists did not know a plume of water erupts from beneath the icy surface of Enceladus until after NASA’s Cassini spacecraft arrived at Saturn. The spacecraft looked at the temperature, pressure and composition of the global ocean and suggested the presence of hydrothermal activity. Hydrothermal activity represents extreme environments and if some form of life exists there, it is highly evolved to live in this environment,    Many places on Earth could have conditions similar to extraterrestrial locations. Just as NASA's Mars rovers made their trial runs on Earth's deserts, researchers are using extreme undersea conditions on Earth to understand extraterrestrial life. Lō`ihi is an especially good place to test both hypotheses and technology and to search for clues about environments on alien worlds and their potential to support life. A project, called SUBSEA, short for Systematic Underwater Biogeochemical Science and Exploration Analog is designed to assess extreme enviroments on Earth and will help prepare future exploration across the solar system. SUBSEA’s scientific target for 2018 is Lō`ihi seamount, an active submarine volcano off the coast of the island of Hawai. Warm, bubbling springs emerge from its underwater volcano. So, Lō`ihi can provide a realistic representation of hydrothermal activity scientists believe exist on the moons of Jupiter and Saturn.    “Throughout the 2018 SUBSEA expedition aboard the vessel Nautilus, the team’s scientists from NASA, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration and various academic institutions will study the conditions around Lō`ihi’s seafloor springs across a range of pressures and temperatures,” explains NASA statement . “What they learn here will increase our understanding of the potential for conditions that could support life forms on other ocean worlds.”","contentWithMarkup":"Volcanic activity in Hawaii's Lō`ihi could be similar to that of found in Europa and Enceladus seafloor volcanoes    Most scientists believe that life can exist beyond Earth.
