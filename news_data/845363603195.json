The Supreme Court (SC) in a landmark ruling that voted 8-6 to oust her included a show cause order for Sereno to explain why she should not be sanctioned for “casting aspersions and ill motives” against SC Associate Justices.    Sereno also disputed the SC decision favoring the quo warranto petition against her as “marred by errors.”    “This is in the realm of possibilities,” lawyer Josa Deinla, one of Sereno’s spokespersons, said in a forum yesterday. She noted that the show cause order of the SC that accompanied the ruling that ousted her may actually be a preview of the next move against Sereno.    “It is not hidden from us that among the disciplinary measures available to the Supreme Court as the highest disciplinary body in the judiciary is to revoke his license as a lawyer,” Deinla said.    The SC decision was penned by Associate Justice Noel Tijam. It said Sereno may be held liable for disbarment for allegedly violating the sub judice rule. The ruling said Sereno repeatedly discussed the merits of her case in a manner that could sway the tribunal’s vote and influence public opinion.    The SC referred to the statements of Sereno in several forums including television interviews in which she referred to details of the impeachment and quo warranto proceedings against her.    Deinla said that in responding to the SC show cause order, Sereno, with her several public engagements as Chief Justice, she needs to review each of the events she attended to explain the statements she made to prove that she did not violate the sub judice rule.    Sereno, in a statement, said the SC decision that granted the quo warranto petition seeking her ouster “was marred by numerous legal and factual errors and due process violations which are sufficient to warrant its reversal.”    In the 205-page motion for reconsideration she recently filed, Sereno argued that the majority decision and concurred in by seven other justices — six of whom she sought to inhibit from the case due to their extreme bias and prejudice against her — reversed settled legal doctrines and principles, resulting in “inherent inconsistencies in the court’s conclusions of law and evaluation of evidence.”    “Basic, fundamental, and long-standing constitutional and legal rules and principles, and settled judicial precedents, were ignored, set aside, and reversed by the majority decision, to achieve one end—the disqualification and ouster of the Chief Justice,” Sereno said in her motion filed through her lawyers led by Alex Poblador.    “More than its numerous legal and factual errors, the Decision proves that in meting out justice, an impartial tribunal is crucial and indispensable. The Decision illustrates vividly the dire and far-reaching consequences of a denial of due process,” Sereno added.    Sereno charges Tijam of ‘prejudgment’    In her motion, Sereno questioned the manner by which Tijam handled the petition as member-in-charge, giving rise to perception of prejudgment on his part.    She said the footnotes of Tijam’s 153-page ponencia would reveal that the decision was already being drafted as early as March 15, or four days before she even submitted her comment to the quo warranto petition in the afternoon of March 19.    Based on these footnotes, it appeared that the drafting of the decision had already commenced, and certain websites and online articles, which were used in the ponencia, had already been “visited” on March 15 and March 19, the same date Sereno submitted her comment.    “These show that Respondent never had a chance from the start. Justice Tijam had condemned Respondent before he heard her,” Sereno lamented.    Sereno also assailed Tijam for taking cognizance of several pieces of evidence which neither party in the quo warranto case had submitted.    As an example, Tijam mentioned in his ponencia about a finding that Sereno’s July 23, 2012 letter to the Judicial and Bar Council (JBC) explaining why she only submitted her Statements of Assets, Liabilities and Net Worth (SALNs) as SC magistrate, and not as University of the Philippines professor, was allegedly not deliberated upon by the council’s executive committee.    Such finding was not based on any evidence on record, but a footnote in the decision indicated it was based on a letter dated April 6, 2018 sent by JBC executive officer Atty. Annaliza Ty-Capacite to Tijam’s office, responding to his request made through a phone call.    Sereno questioned the propriety of Tijam making a phone call to a JBC official to inquire about a matter that was not presented as evidence by any of the parties in the quo warranto case, particularly the Office of the Solicitor General (OSG) which filed the petition.    “That the ponente made or caused such a call to be made is not allowed and shows prejudice,” Sereno said. “If a judge who suggested to a party what evidence it should present was held to have ‘transgressed the boundaries of impartiality,’ with all the more reason should a Justice who motu proprio looked for and considered evidence which neither party submitted be held to have transgressed such bounds.”    Tijam is one of the six magistrates whose inhibitions were sought by Sereno due to their actual bias, prejudice and animosity towards her as shown in their testimonies in the impeachment hearings at the House of Representatives, their questions during the oral arguments on the quo warranto case, and their participation in the so-called “Red Monday” protest at the SC that called for the resignation of the Chief Justice.    The five others are Associate Justices Teresita Leonardo De Castro, Diosdado Peralta, Lucas Bersamin, Francis Jardeleza and Samuel Martires. All six justices voted to grant the quo warranto petition, along with Associate Justices Andres Reyes Jr. and Alexander Gesmundo.    No jurisdiction    Sereno said the SC majority acted without jurisdiction and in gross violation of her right to due process when it considered “extraneous matters” or those that were not raised in the petition as corroborative evidence of her supposed lack of integrity.    Sereno took exception to the so-called “additional evidence of dishonesty” cited in the majority decision to support the conclusion that she lacked integrity to qualify as Chief Justice, including allegations that she had no permit from UP to engage in limited practice of profession while in government practice and that she committed tax fraud when she allegedly failed to truthfully declare her income.    “These additional issues ‘resolved’ by the majority were never raised by the OSG in its Petition and Reply. Neither were they included among the issues defined in the Amended Advisory for the oral arguments,” Sereno pointed out.    “More importantly, Respondent objected to the introduction of such issues during the Oral Argument and in her Supplement to her Memorandum Ad Cautelam. Accordingly, jurisdiction to try and decide such issues was never conferred upon this Honorable Court. Any judgment rendered thereon by this Honorable Court is therefore null and void,” she added.    Sereno said the majority also erred in considering the impeachment charges against her as “corroborative evidence” of her alleged lack of integrity, pointing out that these charges were not among the issues raised by the parties in their pleadings.    She noted that the decision itself recognized that the SC had no jurisdiction over matters committed by an impeachable officer after assumption of office.    “By imposing upon the Respondent the penalty of removal from office partly on the basis of these acts, the Decision encroached upon the power of impeachment which rightly belongs to the Congress,” Sereno said.    The top magistrate also accused the majority of violating her constitutional right to be presumed innocent when it accorded evidentiary weight to the impeachment charges against her.    “To stress, these impeachment charges are mere allegations which are yet to be proven during an impeachment trial. It is basic that ‘mere allegation is not evidence and is not equivalent to proof,’” Sereno said.    “With due respect, the majority ignored this basic precept when they took cognizance of the impeachment charges as ‘evidence’ of Respondent’s purported ‘disposition and propensity to commit dishonesty,’” she added","contentWithMarkup":"SERENO   THE  disbarment of former Chief Justice Maria Lourdes Sereno looms large and possible, one of the counsels of the former Supreme Court head bared yesterday.
