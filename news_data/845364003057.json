{"sequenceId":"845364003057","id":"34207169836","language":"English","title":"Worthing Circus Festival Continues with Gandini Juggling","content":"Olivier and Total Theatre award winners Gandini Juggling present 8 Songs – a series of choreographed juggling vignettes set to 8 classic rock and roll songs, as part of Worthing Theatres Summer of Circus festival at the Pavilion Theatre on Friday 22nd June.    The fast-paced show is a tribute to the mythical landscape of popular music; from Dylan’s stream of consciousness realms to the Velvet Underground troubling landscapes, from David Bowie’s soulful escapades to the rocking Rolling Stone’s anthemic joy de vivre. Each song has its own atmosphere and its own micro universe.    Creating a sense of ritual, celebration, and primal tribal energy the piece builds crescendo style from solos and duets to a full cast finale. Meanings will be alluded to, with semi-literal references to the songs themselves.    For anyone looking to practice and develop their skills whilst having fun, the company will also be running a beginner’s juggling workshop on the day.    Gandini Juggling have for over two decades been one of the world’s most prolific and adventurous circus companies. Founded with the aim of fusing Juggling and dance, they have pushed the artistic and technical boundaries of juggling, resulting in performances that delight, astound, and defy easy categorisation. Iconic and iconoclastic in equal measure Gandini Juggling have changed the perception of what juggling is and can be transforming what might be considered a parlour-trick into a rich and distinctive art form in its own right.    Formed by world-renowned jugglers Sean Gandini and Kati Ylä­Hokkala the award winning Gandini Juggling have been at the forefront of contemporary circus for over 25 years. During that time the company have produced over 30 productions, performing 5000 shows (and counting) around the world. Gandini are trailblazers in their field and have developed a reputation as promiscuous collaborators who continue to reinvent and reinvigorate juggling for the 21st century.    8 Songs is performed by Christopher Patfield, Francesca Mari, Frederike Gerstner Inaki Sastre, Jose Triguero, Lynn Scott & Helena Berry. The creative team includes company director Sean Gandini and lighting designer Guy Dickens and the show was co-commissioned by Without Walls Consortium, Ageas Salisbury International Arts Festival and Greenwich & Docklands International Festival.    Tickets for 8 Songs and the jugging workshop at the Pavilion Theatre are available from the Worthing Theatres box office on 01903 206 206 and online at worthingtheatres.co.uk.","contentWithMarkup":"Olivier and Total Theatre award winners Gandini Juggling present 8 Songs – a series of choreographed juggling vignettes set to 8 classic rock and roll songs, as part of Worthing Theatres Summer of Circus festival at the Pavilion Theatre on Friday 22nd June.
