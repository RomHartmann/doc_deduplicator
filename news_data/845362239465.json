There are two WNBA games on for Saturday night. Here’s what’s in store!  Indiana Fever (0-5) vs. New York Liberty (2-3) When: Saturday June 2 at 7 p.m. EST Where: Bankers Life Fieldhouse | TICKETS How to watch: Fox Sports Indiana (Indianapolis area TV) | MSG+ (New York area TV) | WNBA League Pass (worldwide streaming)  Injuries: For the Fever, Shenise Johnson (knee) is out. For the Liberty, Epiphanny Prince (concussion) is questionable. Sugar Rodgers (knee) and Brittany Boyd (Achilles) are out. Storylines to follow Bria Hartley is poised to be the Liberty’s point guard long-term. The sample size is small, but Hartley is averaging five assists and not even one turnover per game. When she was traded to New York from the Mystics in 2017, some were wondering whether Hartley could find a place with the Liberty, even if she is a hometown player. It’s safe to say that she’s passing the test in flying colors. Can Indiana dig out of a hole? The Fever weren’t expected to be this year’s WNBA champions, but an 0-5 start wasn’t what they were expecting either. They have some good players on their roster, including veteran forward Candice Dupree and rookie guard Kelsey Mitchell, so it would be unwise to count them out of this one.  Dallas Wings (2-3) vs. Seattle Storm (5-1) When: Saturday June 2 at 8 p.m. EST Where: College Park Center | TICKETS How to watch: Fox Sports Southwest Plus (Dallas area TV) | WNBA League Pass (worldwide streaming)  Injuries: For the Wings, Aerial Powers (quadriceps), Glory Johnson (hamstring) and Theresa Plaisance (knee) are out. For the Storm, Crystal Langhorne (ribs) is questionable. Storylines to follow Can Dallas win a game with a big-game Liz Cambage? Cambage scored 28 points and grabbed 16 rebounds in a close loss against the Liberty. Though Breanna Stewart provides a unique rebounding presence of her own, the Storm don’t have a post player as physically imposing as Cambage. On the other hand, the Liberty have Tina Charles, who is more than capable of going toe-to-toe with Cambage. Will Jewell Loyd continue her streak of 20-point games? The Storm’s fourth-year guard averaged 20 or more points in each of her last five games while shooting at least 50 percent from the field in each one of them. Seattle also won every game with Loyd putting up these kinds of numbers. If Loyd can pull off a similar performance tonight, Seattle could very well go 6-1.","contentWithMarkup":"<img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/3oZXM4o2nzW02v_GnKzWZIHgSFA=/0x0:2078x1385/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/59932389/963213028.jpg.0.jpg\" />\n\n\n\n  <p>The Fever look to get their first win of the season, while the Wings hope to get back to .500 on Saturday night against a surging Storm team.</p> <p id=\"WhGuz3\">There are two WNBA games on for Saturday night.
