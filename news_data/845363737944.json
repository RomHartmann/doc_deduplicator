William Ovenell, Grindelwald.      Emergency Housing     We have the expertise to provide emergency housing quite rapidly.        There are many possibilities:     The modules produced for the university and collected together at Inveresk are cheap and quick to build.  Architecture students at Inveresk have devised compact housing units that could be utilised.  Timber World at Meander build single units, quickly assembled  In Texas, USA, they are now 3D printing new houses     In Detroit, USA, cheap single units are being built. So the designs and strategies are available, we just need to get on with the job.        If we place these emergency homes on individual plots, make it all rentable and eventually ownable, we would be a long way down the track to overcoming homelessness.      Dick James, Launceston.      Inner City Developments     IT IS encouraging that the council is finally supporting development of infill living in Launceston to revitalise the central business district into a vibrant living area.      It’s a pity that this hasn’t permeated into the council bureaucracy.      Having witnessed a developer’s recent project I have been waiting to see what other barriers and objections that they have to overcome, maybe run over hot coals, swim a crocodile-infested river, or wrestle a team of grizzly bears.      Had the problems been foreseen they would possibly not of gone ahead considering the emotional and financial cost.      With the obvious benefits to the council and the city to having a vibrant and living CBD the council must put in place procedures to encourage, not dampen development.      I suggest three simple changes that would help.      Appoint a designated officer with the brief to encourage development in CBD, to assist and guide developers with the planning application and project process to overcome red tape barriers.      Grant a rates holiday, of say 10 years, for any development improvement for the inner city.      Pressure the state government to exempt approved inner-city development from stamp duty for property transfers.      I look forward to further developments from proponents to compliment major council upgrades such as the Quadrant, Civic Square and City Mall to revitalise the city centre.      Kevin Best, Trevallyn.       I WOULD like to thank Owen and Helen Tilbury, and fellow organisers of the wonderful BOFA film festival.       I have watched 14 of the movies on offer over throughout the festival and I must say their selections were brilliant.It was a terrific opportunity to see quality films from all over the world.       The entire event was well organised with the help of Anthony of Village Cinemas and the new time of year and venue is just perfect. I can recommend it to all film lovers in Launceston, so put it in your diary for next year.       Sue Saunders, South Launceston.      AS LOYAL Poms, we settled down to a few hours of the royal wedding.       Somehow, for it is hard to explain, we felt that we were seeing a new era of royalty. A prince who was deeply hurt by the death of his mother turning into a very caring force.        He is in a position to stimulate good works in many societies and is now joined by a wife who seems to have some remarkable qualities.       It is interesting to note that she may not be the first American Princess but she is not the first mixed race coloured one in our royal family. (For that we must look to the wife of George the third.)      One prays that the governments of the world will support this couple in their work for they have a great mission in their hearts and minds.      Len Langan, Longford.     Royal Wedding     CONGRATULATIONS to the Brits and their Monarchy.      With their typical skill and grace, they made the world’s loudest democratic declaration in favour of multi-racial, multicultural, multi-denominational, multi-societal behaviour and all through the power and process of love.      No world leader can trump that. Be mindful fellow Aussie when considering our future, that it is from this nation that our country has built its philosophies, and progressed to what it is today.      Do you really want a republic and a president?      I. Shanley, Trevallyn.","contentWithMarkup":"THERE is quite desperation from some family carers of aged disabled people at home, that so little has been done about the financial burden they suffer.        These people have made a massive contribution. Their dedication continues to save the government billions.        Family carers receive about $60 a week, 36 cents an hour for their seven days, 24 hours work.  There is a need for a substantial increase to their payment.        The government approved providers and services can recieve about $50,000 plus out of pocket fees from clients for a level 4 for between about 10 and 14 hours service.        The case management can eat up to 30 to 50 per cent of the package, thereby reducing the front line services and equipment.        Some improvement would allow home carers to nominate themselves as providers and receive funding for services rendered.        This would increase the hours of front-line services.        It’s disappointing the Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull and Treasurer Scott Morrison have not in the budget recognised one of their responsibilities includes an ability to distinguish between those in urgent need, than being domineered by wealthy elites who have more than they will ever need.
