[non-dream tanka written 5-5-18. Like yesterday's tanka, this one's been hanging around for a while. I've even considered scrapping it, and I'm only posting it today because I have nothing else I'd rather. The question is an actual one I came up against in myself and quickly dismissed. But then drafted this tanka about it. It's point puts me in mind of that saying (I've forgotten who said it): nothing first, if not a dream.

Some non dream focused posts are book reviews, \"regular\" poems (some by other writers), scifaiku, writing exercises, Tarot haiku, photos, haiga, and so on.
