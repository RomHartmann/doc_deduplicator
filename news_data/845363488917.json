{"sequenceId":"845363488917","id":"34207152925","language":"English","title":"Restricted (Decal/Permit) Parking Zone","content":"The Randolph Neighborhood Association met on Wednesday, May 16, 2018 to discuss a Restricted (Decal/Permit) Parking Zone in the north east corner of the neighborhood. The goal of this meeting was to determine the scope of the restricted area, time, hours, number of permits per households, and to determine the timeline.  The scope: AREA: Please see the map above to view the areas that are most impacted by VCU parking.  The area in blue is the primary focus for collection of signatures. The areas in yellow are secondary and can easily be added to the petition. Please note by creating a restricted (permit) parking zone, students parking in the neighborhood may be pushed further in. So if you live on Lakeview and feel you should be included, please so say. Once the Restricted (Permit) Parking Zone becomes an ordinance it CANNOT be changed for a full calendar year. All restricted (permit) parking areas are for one (1) hour; except: ♦ The Harrison Street bridge and the Northside of Grayland will become three (3) hour parking. ♦   If you have a permit, you do not need to worry about the restrictions. ♦   If you are not in this part of the neighborhood, you do not need to worry about this.   \tTIME: The restriction will be Monday through Friday from 7am to 9pm \tPERMITS PER HOUSEHOLD: 3; $25/each \tGUEST PASSES: 1; $35  The timeline for this project: May/June 2018 – Solicited feedback via social media and website from neighbors to determine if the scope needs to change/added to. Monday, July 16, 2018 – The Randolph Neighborhood Association meets and will hear final feedback from neighbors in the proposed restricted (Decal/Permit) parking zone. August 2018 – Collection of signatures will begin. September 2018– Signatures will be turned into the DPW Parking Division. A parking study will be conducted. January 2019 – If approved, Decal/Permit parking will begin. Why is the Randolph Neighborhood Association pushing this now? The Oregon Hill neighborhood is moving forward with their restricted (Decal/Permit) parking in the Fall 2018. This will leave Randolph as the only non-restricted parking surrounding VCU. Currently, neighbors in the area without off street parking are already having a hard time with parking. You can read through the Fan District and Carver District Restricted Parking Q&A on the city website. It will likely answer any questions you may have. Fan District: http://www.richmondgov.com/Parking/FanDistrict.aspx Carver District: http://www.richmondgov.com/Parking/CarverDistrict.aspx Again, updates will be provided during the regular quarterly meeting on Monday, July 16, 2018 at 6:30pm. If you are interested in helping collect signatures for the parking area or have questions, please email us at randolphrva@gmail.com. The petition cannot change once signatures are collected.","contentWithMarkup":"<p style=\"font-weight:400;\"><strong>The Randolph Neighborhood Association</strong> met on Wednesday, May 16, 2018 to discuss a <strong>Restricted (Decal/Permit) Parking Zone</strong> in the north east corner of the neighborhood.
