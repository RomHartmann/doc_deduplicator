Before the algorithm change in July 2016, Instagram said its users missed 70 percent of all posts and 50 percent of their friends’ posts. Now, the app said it’s also seen an increase in the time users spend on the app.    Instagram feels so confident about its algorithm, it invited reporters to visit its headquarters to hear exactly how the algorithm works. To customize your feed, Instagram relies on machine learning based on your past behavior—so even if you follow the exact same accounts as someone else, you’ll still have a personalized feed based on how you interact with those accounts.    To create that personal feed, Instagram relies on three main factors—how much you’ll care about a post (based on past behavior), how recently the post was shared, and how close you are with the person who shared it (how often you interact with one another on the app). Additionally, Instagram takes into consideration how often you open the app, how many people you follow, and how long you spend on the app once you’ve checked it.     Instagram reveals the algorithmic criteria it uses to rank the feed: Interest, Recency, and Relationship. It's team also busted myths about shadowbans, downranking, and favoring certain content https://t.co/4gygcm78KT    — Josh Constine (@JoshConstine) June 1, 2018    The Instagram staff also addressed some common questions and theories its users often ask. For example, Instagram confirmed it does not plan to add an option to have the reverse chronological feed because it doesn’t want to add complexity to the app. The staff also said it doesn’t work against people who post more frequently, use a lot of hashtags, or maintain a business account, nor does it work in favor of people who use Stories or the Live feature.    Despite the positive talks about user engagement, Instagram users on Twitter still aren’t satisfied.     Sooo over the @instagram algorithm! Please go back to chronological feed!    — Liz (@PalmPineappBlog) May 29, 2018     1. The Instagram Algorithm https://t.co/gW3dbzKxgX    — emma is sick & hoping to go to bookcon tomorrow!
