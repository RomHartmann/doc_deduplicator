Following addresses by the candidates, balloting will take place this afternoon.    Convention endorsements go to statewide candidates who receive a majority vote of the delegates. But any candidate who receives 15 percent of delegate votes earns a place on the ballot for the Sept. 4 primary, which will decide the nominees for the general election on Nov. 6.    Vying for the endorsement for governor are Jay Gonzalez, of Needham, who served as secretary of administration and finance under Gov. Deval Patrick, and Bob Massie, of Somerville, an environmental activist, author and Episcopal priest who was Democratic nominee for lieutenant governor in 1994.    A third candidate, Setti Warren, former mayor of Newton, shook up the race when he dropped out in April.    Mr. Gonzalez, in his address to the convention on Saturday, shackled incumbent Republican Gov. Charlie Baker to President Donald Trump.    “Baker hides behind the chaos that Trump creates,” Mr. Gonzalez said. “He hopes we’ll lower our expectations and simply be grateful he isn’t crazy like our president.    “Well, Charlie, you can’t hide from us! We are pulling back the curtain on your failed leadership! We expect more from our governor! Not being crazy is not good enough!”    Mr. Gonzalez, perhaps a foot shorter in height than 6-foot-6 former Harvard basketball player Mr. Baker, referenced his own diminutive stature to say he and the Democratic Party fight for the “little guy.”    He recalled shaking hands with a voter who told him: “You’re too short to be governor!”    Mr. Gonzalez continued: “Yes, I’m a little guy. But not just because of my height.    “While I’ve been fortunate in many respects, it hasn’t always been easy. As the only Spanish kid where I grew up, I was the target of hurtful, ethnic slurs. In college, I struggled through a deep depression after my best friend and roommate, Pete, unexpectedly died.    “My parents were little guys too. My mom dropped out of college to take care of me. My dad didn’t speak English, and he’d never been to college.    “But they believed and worked hard. They raised three sons. My mom became a public school teacher and member of the teacher’s union. My dad became a successful small businessman and a proud American citizen.    “And it’s what the Democratic Party is all about. Democrats have always believed in the little guy. We have always fought for the little guy. We have always understood that the little guy is us.    “Today’s Republican Party doesn’t give a damn about the little guy,” Mr. Gonzalez said.    “Donald Trump is a racist and a bully, who assaults women and taunts people with disabilities; gives tax cuts to his wealthy friends; and builds walls to keep the little guys out.    “And let me be clear: Charlie Baker doesn’t care about the little guy either.”    Mr. Massie, laying out a progressive vision for the governorship, said he wanted to be “the people’s governor.” He also tied the Republican incumbent to Mr. Trump.    “The Republican Party abandoned its values in order to achieve power, and in doing so they sold their soul to the monied interests, who use them as a tool, and Charlie Baker is the epitome of that failure,” Mr. Massie said.    “No, he is not Trump,” he said. “Baker does not say hateful things, but it is what he does not say that shows the emptiness of his heart and the absence of his spine. His silence speaks for him.    “When tens of thousands of people exercise their right of assembly, and show up over and over again in the streets demanding change, you would think the governor of that state might show up or say something. But he’s too terrified of Donald Trump.”    In the contest for lieutenant governor, delegates have the opportunity to back a stand-up comic for their party’s ticket in the fall.    Jimmy Tingle, of Cambridge, the political humorist, said he’s “100 percent serious” about his bid for the state’s second-highest office. His rival for the lieutenant-governor nomination is attorney Quentin Palfrey, of Weston, a Southboro native who was a senior advisor for in the White House Office of Science & Technology Policy under President Obama.    Mr. Tingle, addressing the convention, wove humor into a blue-collar appeal to old-time Democratic values aimed at “people we have lost and people who have been left behind.”    “Government matters. Government can save people’s lives,” Mr. Tingle said. “I believe in God and the power of government to change people’s lives.”    His political philosophy, and the Democrats’, he said, is to “feed the hungry, house the homeless, heal the sick, welcome the stranger — and I would add, fix the T.”    He said: “If John F. Kennedy could inspire a generation to go to the moon, we could get a high-speed rail to Springfield.”    Former Congressman Barney Frank, nominating Mr. Tingle, described the comedian, who earned a master's in public administration from Harvard’s Kennedy School, as “righteous without being self-righteous,” delivering “a serious moral message with humor.”    Mr. Palfrey told delegates “our American values are under attack” at this moment in the nation’s history.    “When I was thinking about running for office last summer, there were these awful events in Charlottesville,” Mr. Palfrey said. “ And I remember seeing this small group of students — some were white and some were black — and they were standing in front of a sign that said ‘Virginia students against white supremacy.’ And all around them were people with tiki torches — remember the tiki torches?    “And some of the signs had swastikas on them, and some of the people in the crowd were members of the Ku Klux Klan. And I asked myself, ‘What am I going to tell my children, and my grandchildren, that I did when our American values were so obviously under attack?’    “And I want to tell them that we stood up, and we fought back, and we pounded our fists on the table and screamed till we were hoarse that that isn’t the kind of America we want to live in,” he said.    Whomever the convention endorses for governor and lieutenant governor, the Democratic ticket is expected to face an uphill fight this year against the Republican incumbents, Gov. Charlie Baker of Swampscott and Lieut. Gov. Karyn Polito of Shrewsbury.    While Democrats predominate in blue Massachusetts, Mr. Baker, rated the nation’s most popular governor in a Morning Consult survey, enjoys job approval ratings near 70 percent, and according to the state Office of Campaign and Political Finance, has more than $8 million in his campaign chest. Mr. Gonzalez reported less than $132,000 on hand as of mid-May, and Mr. Massie, just $18,000, according to the OCPF.    “Don’t believe the insiders who say Baker can’t be beat,” Mr. Gonzalez told delegates. “The media and the special interests and the pundits don’t decide who our governor is going to be. We decide. We decide!”    Delegates on Saturday also will endorse a candidate for secretary of state. The six-term incumbent, William Galvin, who has served 24 years, faces a challenge from Josh Zakim, a Boston city councilor and son of the late religious and civil rights leader Leonard Zakim, namesake of the Bunker Hill Bridge.    More than 6,000 delegates converged at the DCU Center this weekend for the two-day convention, according to the state party.","contentWithMarkup":"WORCESTER — Democratic State Convention delegates are at the DCU Center today to endorse candidates for governor, lieutenant governor, and secretary of state.
