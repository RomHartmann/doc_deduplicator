{"sequenceId":"845363831462","id":"34207164849","language":"English","title":"Today's Word With Joel & Victoria Osteen - Stand and See","content":"TODAY'S SCRIPTURE: \"Moses answered the people, 'Do not be afraid. Stand firm and you will see the deliverance the LORD will bring you today…the LORD will fight for you; you need only to be still.'\" Exodus 14:13-14, NIV TODAY'S WORD: In the Bible, when the people of Israel came out of slavery and were headed toward the Promise Land, they were so happy to finally be free! But then Pharaoh changed his mind about letting them go and came chasing after them. They came to a dead end at the Red Sea and things looked impossible. Instead of staying in faith and focusing on the fact that God had delivered them before, the Israelites got upset, fearful and started complaining, “Moses, why did you bring us out here to die?” Moses replied, “Stand still and you will see the deliverance of the Lord.” He went on to say, “The Lord will fight for you if you will hold your peace and remain at rest.” The Lord was faithful to His Word and delivered them again.  Moses knew he had to get the people out of that negative mentality or they would be defeated, and the same is true for you. You may be in a storm of life, but don’t let that storm get in you. Instead, set your focus on God because He is faithful, and He will fight your battles. Stay calm and remain in peace today because God is going to deliver you and lead you into your promise land! PRAYER FOR TODAY: \"Father, thank You for Your goodness and faithfulness in my life. Help me keep my heart and mind focused on You. No matter what storm I may be facing, I trust that You are working behind the scenes and ordering my steps to the promise land You have for me in Jesus’ name. Amen.\"","contentWithMarkup":"<p class=\"subhead\" style=\"margin:0px31px;padding:15px0px;border:0;font-weight:bold;font-style:normal;font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;vertical-align:baseline;font-size:18px;font-variant:normal;line-height:20px;color:rgb(137,159,165);text-transform:uppercase;letter-spacing:normal;orphans:2text-indent: 0;white-space:normal;widows:2;word-spacing:0;background-color:rgb(255,255,255);text-decoration-style:initial;text-decoration-color:initial;text-align:left;\">TODAY'S SCRIPTURE:</p>\n<p style=\"margin:0px31px;padding:0px0px20px;border:0;font-weight:400;font-style:normal;font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;vertical-align:baseline;font-size:14px;font-variant:normal;line-height:18px;color:rgb(63,79,85);letter-spacing:normal;orphans:2text-indent: 0;text-transform:none;white-space:normal;widows:2;word-spacing:0;background-color:rgb(255,255,255);text-decoration-style:initial;text-decoration-color:initial;text-align:left;\">\"Moses answered the people, 'Do not be afraid.
