Families from all over the Big Country came out to Adventure Cove in Abilene on Friday, which was the first full day of summer after the school year, to enjoy the $6 million aquatic center, which is another marvelous product of the City of Abilene's 2015 bond program.    Adventure Cove officially opened last year and tickets sales at the aquatic center reached a total of $279,000 in the facility's inaugural season, with the money earned from ticket sales going toward helping to pay the aquatic center’s operational expenses.    Local children could care less about the money being made off of ticket sales because they are just at the aquatic center to splash around and get some relief from the 100 degree temperatures that have descended upon the Big Country.    For parents, going to Adventure Cove, it is more than just another day in the sun, it’s about making memories with their little ones that will last for a lifetime and bringing out their inner child by remembering all of the great stuff that summer vacation represents in their lives.    Adventure Cove, which is located at 2742 S 9th St. in Abilene, is open on Sunday and Monday from 1 p.m. to 7 p.m. and open on Tuesday through Saturday from 11 a.m. to 7 p.m.    Admission for adults at Adventure Cove is $7, while children get in for $6, children under 48 inches only cost $4 and children 2 years old and under get into the aquatic center for free.","contentWithMarkup":"ABILENE, Texas —   Since summer break is officially underway in the Big Country, that means that it is the perfect time for kids to swim and be lazy.
