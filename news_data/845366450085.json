{"sequenceId":"845366450085","id":"34207242491","language":"English","title":"Letter to editor: Downingtown Area School District move to eliminate school nurses from Shanahan is discriminatory","content":"The DASD decision to eliminate daily nursing services at Bishop Shanahan High School from the $2.2 million preliminary 2018-2019 budget is discriminatory, since no nursing services are being cut from the public schools. Eliminating daily nursing services is a great injustice to BSHS students and to their parents as DASD taxpayers.    Funding for school nursing services is provided not only by the school district where the non-public school is located but by the state of Pennsylvania as well. DASD submits for annual state reimbursement of the nursing services provided to BSHS, based on total enrollment at the school, since it lies within District boundaries.    Additionally, the residents of the Downingtown Area School District who choose to send their children to Bishop Shanahan represent a significant collective cost savings of over $4,000,000.00 annually for district taxpayers, that vastly exceeds the cost of providing BSHS students with the nursing services that they deserve. Furthermore, annual property tax dollars paid by BSHS families to the DASD deserve more than the minimum services of annual health screenings and bus transportation from the over $220,000,000 budget that the DASD will be seeking to approve at the June 13 board meeting.    This budget must not be allowed to pass without the reversal of the discriminatory cost cutting measure of eliminating daily nurse services from BSHS, in order that all district school children receive the services to which they are entitled.      The DASD Board must be held accountable to all taxpayers within the district, and not just represent those who send their children to the public schools. The Downingtown Area School District Health Services Parent Handbook’s cover ironically says it best: “Every child deserves a school nurse.”    Apparently, the District has now decided that not every child – and certainly not the non-public school child – deserves a school nurse. The Downingtown Area School District needs to back up their words with funding because all school children deserve daily school nursing services!
