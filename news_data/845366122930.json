The study, led by Andrew W. Lo   \"As a new era of drug development dawns, scientists are finding cures and treatments for different types of cancers every day.

And if there is one patient population that really needs our support and advocacy, it's our children.\"   Even as our understanding of childhood cancers is growing and mortality rates are declining, pharmaceutical companies are facing significant disincentives in pursuing new treatments. For one thing, the market for these drugs is relatively small. Childhood cancer is a rare disease-only about 15,000 cases are diagnosed in the U.S. per year. Because it's so rare, and because drug pricing is such a sensitive subject lately, pharmaceutical companies have fewer economic incentives to invest in pediatric oncology drug development.   Another factor is the scientific challenges in pediatric oncology due to the smaller number of genetic mutations in children that can serve as drug targets. Moreover, the biology of an infant is very different from that of an adolescent, which differs still from that of a young adult, making drug development even more complex for children. Also, because drug candidates sometimes have toxic side effects, pharmaceutical companies are reluctant to include children in clinical trials until safety has first been established in adults.   Finally, drug pricing remains a big obstacle.

In further simulations involving philanthropic support, government guarantees, and portfolios of assets that include both late- and early-stage assets, the study reported expected returns ranging from –5.6% to 22.5%. \"In the public/private partnership simulation, the private sector does the heavy lifting, but the so-called 'Valley of Death'-the process of taking preclinical research through to Phase 1 clinical trials, where the financial risk is greatest-is taken on by government and charitable groups,\" says Lo. \"Philanthropic support helps pay for the R&D in the early stages and the government guarantee reduces the downside risk of investment at a reasonably low cost to taxpayers. This is the kind of collaborative approach that's needed to make pediatric cancer drug development attractive to investors and the private sector.\"   To encourage other researchers and practitioners to experiment with and extend their analysis, the authors published the full details of the simulations in the supplementary materials that accompany the article. The team also made all of their computer code open- source and freely available.   \"Our hope is that government agencies, policymakers, philanthropists, drug companies, and investors will be motivated to action by our findings,\" he says. \"Treating childhood cancer is a nonpartisan issue, and under the right financing and business structures, we can do well by doing good.\" View original content with multimedia:http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/new-study-by-mit-sloan-researchers-provides-insights-on-the-challenges-of-developing-drugs-for-pediatric-cancerand-offers-a-potential-solution-300658197.html  ©2017 PR Newswire.
