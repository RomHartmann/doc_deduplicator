The passage of the resolution followed a motion moved by the Majority Leader, Adeyinka Mafe, seconded by the Minority Leader,  Olawale Alausa and supported by the Whole House, through a voice vote.    Opening the debate on the governor’s request, shortly after the Speaker ,Rt Hon Suraju Adekunbi acknowledged the Governor’s request through a correspondence, dated 30th of May, 2018, Mafe, while citing order 21 rule of the House, explained that the approval became necessary, to validate the fund expended in the procurement of military hardware, meant to tackle the menace of insecurity being faced by the nation.    He added that the step by the federal government to procure military hardware from the United States (US) to support the Armed forces in its ongoing operations to end insurgency and other security challenges in the country needed to be commended, as the previous government could not secure the window for such purchase from the US in the last ten years.

Also speaking, other lawmakers including Atanda Rasaq,  Akinpelu Aina,  Bowale Solaja and Adebowale Ojuri remarked that effective security network was essential to the growth and development of any nation, saying that the decision for the approval was aimed at complementing government’s efforts at tackling insecurity, at all levels of government.
