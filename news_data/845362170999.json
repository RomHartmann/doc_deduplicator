Examples: Consider the following binary tree\r20 / \\ 10 26 / \\ / \\ 4 18 24 27 / \\\r14 19\r/ \\\r13 15\rInput : 4\rOutput : 10\rPreorder traversal of given tree is 20, 10, 4, 18, 14, 13, 15, 19, 26, 24, 27.\rInput : 19\rOutput : 15\rRecommended: Please try your approach on  first, before moving on to the solution. A simple solution is to first store Preorder traversal of the given tree in an array then linearly search given node and print node next to it. Time Complexity : O(n) Auxiliary Space : O(n) An efficient solution is based on below observations. If left child of given node exists, then the left child is preorder successor. If left child does not exists and given node is left child of its parent, then its sibling is its preorder successor. If none of above conditions are satisfied (left child does not exists and given node is not left child of its parent), then we move up using parent pointers until one of the following happens. We reach root. In this case, preorder successor does not exists Current node (one of the ancestors of given node) is left child of its parent, in this case preorder successor is sibling of current node. // CPP program to find preorder successor of\r// a node in Binary Tree.\r#include <iostream>\rusing namespace std;\rstruct Node ;\rNode* newNode(int key)\r\rNode* preorderSuccessor(Node* root, Node* n)\r\rint main()\r\rOutput: Preorder successor of 19 is 26\rTime Complexity : O(h) where h is height of given Binary Tree Auxiliary Space : O(1) Practice Similar Questions On: Tree NayanGadre Check out this Author's contributed articles.
