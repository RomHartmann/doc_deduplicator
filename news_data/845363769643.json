Before Monday’s council action, only loft apartments located on upper floors above retail uses were permitted in the Decatur Square Business District. With the new ordinance, ground floor apartments will be allowed in a mixed use development through a specific use permit.

Messenger photo by Brian Knox    City Planning Director Dedra Ragland said at the May 14 council meeting during the first reading of the proposed ordinance change that the city began looking at the possibility of a ground floor apartment after being approached by a developer who wanted to put in a three-story building. The structure would have retail on the first floor and apartments on the upper two floors. There would be a single apartment also located on the first floor at 302 West Walnut Street, one block west of the downtown square.    The council unanimously approved the change, allowing the proposed apartment project to move forward.    The council also agreed to participate in a Sanitary Sewer Overflow (SSO) Initiative with the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality.    City Engineer Earl Smith explained that TCEQ had conducted a review of the city’s compliance with wastewater collection systems and recommended the city be placed into the SSO program.    Smith said the program will last nine-and-a-half years – through Dec. 31, 2027 – and will consist of researching the system to find defects and fix them. The ultimate goal is to keep rain water out of the wastewater system.    “Basically, you are committing to do certain things, and in return, [TCEQ is] committing not to fine you unless you don’t do the things you said you would do,” said City Manager Brett Shannon. “As it is right now, if you have an overflow, they can stick you with a fine. So this is just a good faith two-way effort to try to alleviate a problem.”    Smith said the city will provide regular documentation to TCEQ, and the council will receive a report on the progress of the program each year.    In other business, the council appointed or reappointed numerous citizens to various city boards or commissions including the following:    Library Board (terms expire May 31, 2020) – Nancy Rosendahl, Angela Smith, Eric Vincent, Kristen Tribe.  Parks Board (terms expire May 31, 2020) – T.J. Moye, Leanna Mosley (accepted resignation of Misty Hudson).  Conference Center Advisory Board (terms expire May 31, 2020) – Jeannine Eaton, Loraine Burton, Joe Lambert.  Main Street Advisory Board (terms expire May 31, 2020) – Theresa Thornton, John Lanier, Cyndi Fernihough, James Macik (accepted resignation of Diane Sanders).  Cemetery Board (terms expire May 31, 2020) – Gene Blagg, Wayne Stone, Ann Logue, Frank Perrin, Angela Smith.  Cemetery Board officer reappointment (effective until May 31, 2019) – President Ann Logue, Vice-President Wayne Stone, Secretary Joyce Horton.  Planning and Zoning Commission (term expires Oct. 1, 2018) – Will Klose (accepted resignation of Davey Edwards).  Decatur Housing Authority Board of Directors (terms expire June 1, 2020) – Barbara Foster, Coy Stephens, Deidra Deaton.  Kristy Campbell was also appointed as an alternate member of the Zoning Board of Adjustment with a term expiring Oct. 1, 2019.    At the beginning of the meeting, outgoing council member Cary Bohn was presented a plaque for his service to the city by Mayor Martin Woodruff.","contentWithMarkup":"<p>The Decatur City Council Monday approved a zoning change that will allow for an apartment building downtown.</p>\n<p>Before Monday’s council action, only loft apartments located on upper floors above retail uses were permitted in the Decatur Square Business District.
