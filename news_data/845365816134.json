A series of tweets were posted starting at 6:30 p.m. Friday and remained up for about 20 minutes. The posts included vulgar sayings and racial-charged messages, with one showing an image of what looked like a teenage boy with a scarf covering half his face.     The company later issued a statement regarding the hack.     \"Buffalo Wild Wings' Twitter account was hacked,\" a spokesperson for the company said. \"We're sorry that our fans had to see those awful posts, which obviously did not come from us. We are in touch with our Twitter representatives and will pursue the appropriate action against the individuals involved.\"     Well, we were hacked. And it wasn't funny. We apologize for the awful posts, which obviously did not come from us.  -- Buffalo Wild Wings (@BWWings) June 2, 2018   The offensive tweets have since been deleted and Buffalo Wild Wings said it has contacted Twitter about the breach.     ","contentWithMarkup":"Buffalo Wild Wings is apologizing after an apparent hack led to vulgar messages being posted to its official Twitter account.
