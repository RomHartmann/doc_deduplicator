{"sequenceId":"845363786060","id":"34207163198","language":"English","title":"Student Views: Climate change isn't about today's weather","content":"Despite the polarizing opinions and thoughts about climate change, it continues to slowly affect the area around us.    In Wisconsin, you might notice a colder than usual spring, or snow in April, and think what exactly do they mean by climate change? It seems to be getting \"colder.”    The problem with public thinking on climate change is that it’s assumed climate change means only getting progressively warmer everywhere throughout the world.    Climate change affects many aspects of the weather. The main effect is the warming of the oceans and the areas around the oceans. The average temperature of the earth has increased by 1.33 degrees, which melts the ice caps faster and kills off marine life as well as coral reefs in the tropics.    More climate-related events are extreme weather events, such as hurricanes and tornadoes, which have been progressively getting worse due to increased temperatures. In 2017, there was an above-average amount of hurricanes, starting with hurricane Harvey which devastated Texas, causing extensive flooding and damage, as well as hurricanes Irma, Jose and Katia.    Increased temperatures also affect tornadoes, which have been more frequent in the U.S. and have been progressively more powerful. During the past 30 years and throughout the next century, we have seen and will see an increased amount of winter and spring precipitation in the northern U.S. and less in the south.    It is important to realize that climate change is not just whether it's warm or cold outside. Many factors have a far greater impact on our world than people feeling a bit warmer in the winter.
