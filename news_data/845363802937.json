{"sequenceId":"845363802937","id":"34207163944","language":"English","title":"Group gathers to celebrate love of darts","content":"A local group has been getting together to play darts for about 22 years. The Texoma Dart Association will hold its end of season tournament and awards banquet Saturday.    The awards will be presented at 6:30 p.m. and the tournament will begin at 7 p.m. at the Eagles Lodge at 211 W. Main Street in Denison. Anyone can play in Saturday's open tournament. Tacos will be provided by the league and there is a $5 entry fee.    “Texoma Dart Association, formally Red River Dart Association, began in 1996 as a recreational steel tip dart league,” association secretary Glory Malone said in an email. “As with any association, there are bylaws that structure the league play. There are board members that include: president, vice-president, secretary, treasurer, tournament director, and public relations. The board members are responsible for arbitration and enforcement of written bylaws.”    More than just a way to promote the sport of darts, the objective and purpose of the Texoma Dart Association is to keep the sport exclusively for pleasure, recreation and other non-profit purposes.    “We play at bars, clubs and organizations such as VFW, American Legion, Elks, Eagles and other locations that provide a place to accommodate our structured play,” Malone's email said. “There are membership fees of $20.00 per player per season, and the bar, club and organization sponsors our teams for $40 per team, per season. This pays for supplies needed for the TDA such as pins, awards and trophies awarded at the end of each season, as well as food for our awards banquet and tournament at the end of each season. At the end of the year the proceeds left over we donate to Toys for Tots.”    There are from 50-70 players in the league, and the league is made up of teams of up to seven players. Split into two seasons, the league plays from February through May and from August through December.    “We have four open tournaments per year as well that anyone can enter to play at $5 per person,” Malone said. “This is a blind draw for partner. At the end of the year, we host a Toys for Tots tournament. The entry for this tournament is a new, unwrapped toy or cash. All proceeds from tournament, plus money collected from dues, are given to the Toys for Tots Foundation.”    Malone said that last year the TDA gave $700, and the year before they gave $500.    “The league players grow close friendships, almost like family,” Malone said. “I can say myself, being a team captain as well as secretary for this league, my team gets together as often as we can outside of playing darts. Whether it be going to the lake, seeing a sports event, playing golf or going to a child's birthday party. My dart team has very close friendships, we are family. And, I am quite certain that other teams within this league feel the same of theirs.”    TDA plays in the Sherman, Denison and Van Alstyne.    “I encourage anyone that would like to be a part of a great group of people to come join our league,” Malone said. “The camaraderie and sportsmanship is second to none. We play on Thursday nights, once a week.”    To join the league, individuals must gather a team of at least five players. Then contact the Texoma Dart Association on its Facebook page, website texomadarts.com or by emailing glorymalone@yahoo.com    “The board has a meeting before every season to get a count of how many teams will be playing for the upcoming season,” Malone said.","contentWithMarkup":"A local group has been getting together to play darts for about 22 years.
