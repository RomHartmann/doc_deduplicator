In a press release, the San Angelo Police Department identified the driver of the wrecked motorcycle as 33-year-old David Steinbach.    According to authorities, they responded to the 4200 block of Sunset Drive on Friday at around 4:45 a.m. to a report of a motorcycle crash.    When police officers arrived at the scene, they found Steinbach walking around the Pier 1 Imports parking lot suffering from incapacitating injuries.    Steinbach was later transported to Shannon Medical Center.    A preliminary crash investigation conducted by San Angelo Police Department revealed that Steinbach was traveling southbound on Sunset Drive when for an unknown reason, he applied the brakes to his 2012 Harley Davidson and laid the motorcycle down.    The motorcycle continued traveling on its side after Steinbach fell off of it before eventually crashing into a utility guide wire, which caused it to flip.    Authorities are working with nearby businesses to determine if surveillance video of the accident is available, according to the press release.    The accident reduced southbound traffic on Sunset Drive to one lane for several hours.
