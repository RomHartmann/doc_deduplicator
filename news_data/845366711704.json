In a stunning move Saturday, an emotional Wynne conceded her days as premier are over when voters head to the ballot box June 7 — but called on Ontarians to vote Liberal anyway, saying a vote for her party is a vote to keep the next government in check, be it one led by the NDP or the PCs.  At stake for the Liberals are eight seats, which they need to hang on to party status at a time when support has been floundering in the polls amid a virtually neck-in-neck race between the competition.","contentWithMarkup":"Ontario Liberal leader Kathleen Wynne's surprise admission of defeat five days ahead of the election clears the path for her party's candidates to ditch the weight of the premier's unpopularity and race to the finish line on their own steam, many incumbent Liberals say.
