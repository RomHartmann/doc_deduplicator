Is there a time of year that is best to do this? How long will it take for them to regrow again? --Jeni Ducoing Answer: Yes, this can be done. It is best done in the spring, around February or March, before the new spring growth. You may, however, cut them back now and they will still grow back out. When cast iron plants are cut back to the ground, they will grow back out shorter and thinner. It will take them until next summer to get back to the thickness and height they were before you cut them back. If there are not too many unattractive leaves and lots of healthy leaves, it is best to just individually prune out the unattractive leaves. Dan Gill is a horticulturist with the LSU AgCenter.
